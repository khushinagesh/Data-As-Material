Specifically, the variables local, dow, and month have been converted into factors. Each has been assigned specific ordered levels. The local variable indicates whether a ride was local (“no” or “yes”), while dow is now ordered from Monday to Sunday, and month from January to April. This change improves the dataset for analysis where the natural order of days and months is important, making it easier to perform time-based analyses or comparisons.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 1A: Counts of Tips\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# gf_labs- Metadata about the graph\n\nThe bar chart titled “Counts of Tips” displays the frequency of taxi rides where a tip was given versus those where no tip was provided. The chart shows a significantly higher count of rides where a tip was given, with over 7,500 rides including a tip, compared to a much smaller count of rides without a tip, which is under 1,000. This indicates that the majority of taxi rides in this dataset included a tip.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~tip,\n    colour = ~local,\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 2A: Colour Bar Chart\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# colour-outline colour\n\nThis colour-coded bar chart titled “Plot 2A: Colour Bar Chart” displays the count of taxi rides where a tip was given or not, with an additional distinction based on whether the ride was local or not. The darker bars represent non-local rides, while the lighter-coloured edges represent local rides.From the chart, it is clear that the majority of taxi rides where a tip was given were non-local, as the darker colour dominates the “yes” category. Similarly, for rides without a tip, the majority are also non-local. There are relatively few local rides, indicated by the lighter-coloured edges, in both the tip and no-tip categories.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~tip,\n    fill = ~local,\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 2B: Stacked Bar Chart\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# fill- fill the bar with a colour or variable\n\nThis stacked bar chart titled “Plot 2B: Stacked Bar Chart” shows the distribution of taxi rides based on whether a tip was given, with the additional breakdown of local and non-local rides. The purple sections represent non-local rides, while the yellow sections represent local rides. In the “yes” category (rides with a tip), most of the rides are non-local (purple), with a smaller portion being local (yellow). Similarly, in the “no” category (rides without a tip), the majority are also non-local rides.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~tip,\n    fill = ~local,\n    position = \"dodge\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 2C: Dodged Bar Chart\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis “Dodged Bar Chart” (Plot 2C) provides a side-by-side comparison of taxi rides where tips were given or not, categorized by whether the ride was local or non-local. The purple bars represent non-local rides, and the yellow bars represent local rides.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~tip,\n    fill = ~local,\n    position = \"fill\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 2D: Filled Bar Chart\",\n    subtitle = \"Shows Per group differences in Proportions!\"\n  )# position = \"fill\"- Used for proportions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis “Filled Bar Chart” (Plot 2D) shows the proportion of local and non-local taxi rides for both the tipping and non-tipping categories. The purple colour represents non-local rides, and the yellow colour represents local rides.This chart emphasizes the relative proportion of local versus non-local rides rather than the absolute counts, making it useful for understanding the distribution of ride types across tipping behaviour.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~company, fill = ~tip, position = \"fill\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 3A: Proportion of taxi rides where tips were given or not, broken down by different taxi companies\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis “Filled Bar Chart” (Plot 3A) displays the proportion of taxi rides where tips were given or not, broken down by different taxi companies. The blue segments represent rides where tips were given, and the red segments represent rides without tips. From the chart, it is clear that for all companies, the majority of rides resulted in a tip, while the non-tipping rides make up a smaller proportion across all companies. Some companies, like “Flash Cab,” have a slightly larger proportion of non-tipping rides compared to others, but overall, tipping is the dominant behaviour for all the companies displayed. This chart emphasizes the tipping pattern across different taxi providers, showing relatively consistent behaviour.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~hour, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 4: Counts of Tips by Hour\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Counts of Tips by Hour” chart shows the distribution of taxi rides and tipping behaviour throughout the day. The number of rides increases steadily during the morning, peaks between 2 PM and 4 PM, and then declines in the evening. Most rides result in a tip, as indicated by the large blue bars across all hours, with a smaller proportion of non-tipping rides (red bars). The highest concentration of rides and tips occurs during the afternoon hours, while early morning and late evening see fewer rides overall. This pattern highlights that tipping is consistent throughout the day, especially during peak ride times.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~dow, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 5: Counts of Tips by Day of Week\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Counts of Tips by Day of Week” chart shows the number of taxi rides and tipping behaviour across different days of the week. Thursdays have the highest number of rides, followed by Wednesdays, while the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) have the lowest ride counts. Across all days, most rides result in a tip, as indicated by the blue bars. A small portion of rides, particularly on weekdays, do not result in a tip, shown by the red bars. Overall, tipping behavior is consistent throughout the week, but ride volumes peak midweek and decrease during the weekend.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~month, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 6: Counts of Tips by Month\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the distribution of taxi rides and tipping behaviour over the months of January through April. March and April show the highest ride counts, both exceeding 3,000 rides, with a significant majority of these rides resulting in tips. February has a moderate number of rides, slightly lower than March and April, but tipping behavior remains strong. January has the fewest rides, but similarly, most rides result in tips. Overall, tipping appears consistent across all four months, with a clear trend of most taxi rides receiving tips, regardless of the month.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ month | dow, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 7: Counts of Tips by Day of Week and Month\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multi-faceted bar chart depicts the counts of taxi rides and tipping patterns across different days of the week (Monday to Sunday) and months (January to April). For most days of the week, March and April show higher counts of rides compared to January and February. Thursdays and Fridays have the highest ride counts, with a strong tendency toward tipping, particularly in March and April. Sundays generally have the fewest rides but maintain a steady tipping trend. Overall, tipping behaviour remains consistent across different days, with the majority of rides receiving tips, especially as the year progresses into spring months.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ dow | hour, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 8A: Counts of Tips by Hour and Day of Week\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart shows the distribution of taxi rides and tipping behaviour across different hours of the day and days of the week. Tipping generally follows a similar pattern throughout the week, with the highest ride counts and tips occurring between 8 AM and 6 PM, particularly around midday. Monday through Friday sees more rides, with a peak tipping period from 8 AM to 3 PM. The early morning and late evening hours (before 7 AM and after 9 PM) have significantly fewer rides and tips. Weekends, especially Sundays, show lower overall ride and tipping activity throughout all hours of the day.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ dow | hour, fill = ~tip, position =\"fill\", data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 8B: Proportions of Tips by Hour and Day of Week\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart visualizes the proportion of taxi rides that result in tips across different hours of the day ( segregated as multiple graphs) and days of the week ( x-axis). The consistent blue (representing tips) across most hours and days suggests that a large majority of rides result in tipping, regardless of the time or day. However, some fluctuations occur, particularly during early morning hours (2 AM - 5 AM) on weekdays, when the percentage of rides without tips (in red) increases slightly. Despite these minor variations, tipping appears to be a regular part of most rides across all hours and days.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ hour | dow, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 9: Counts of Tips by Hour and Day of Week\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart illustrates the distribution of taxi rides that resulted in tips across different hours of the day (x-axis) for each day of the week( shown as different graphs). The data reveals that tipping patterns are fairly consistent throughout the week, with peak hours for tipping occurring in the late morning to afternoon (around 9 AM to 3 PM). The chart also shows that there are fewer rides without tips (in red) during these peak hours, while early morning and late-night hours, especially on weekends, tend to have a smaller proportion of tipping. Thursdays and Fridays appear to have the highest number of taxi rides with tips.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~hour, fill = ~tip, position =\"fill\", data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 10: Counts of Tips by Hour\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart illustrates the proportion of taxi rides that resulted in tips (in blue) versus no tips (in red) across different hours of the day. The majority of taxi rides during all hours tend to result in a tip, as indicated by the dominant blue colour in the chart. There is a slightly higher proportion of rides without tips in the early morning (around 1 AM to 5 AM) and later in the night, but overall, tipping remains consistent throughout the day, with a slight dip in tip occurrences during off-peak hours.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~dow, fill = ~tip, position =\"fill\", data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 11: Counts of Tips by Day of Week\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart shows the proportion of taxi rides that received tips (in blue) versus no tips (in red) for each day of the week. Across all days, a majority of rides result in tips, as shown by the larger blue segments in each bar. The proportion of no-tips (red) remains fairly consistent throughout the week, with no significant differences between the days. This suggests that tipping behaviour is relatively uniform, regardless of the day of the week.\n\n\n\n\ndata(\"HELPrct\")\nHELPrct\n\n    age anysubstatus anysub cesd  d1 daysanysub dayslink drugrisk

These variables include data related to demographic characteristics (like age, sex), substance use (such as anysub, daysanysub), risks (drugrisk, sexrisk), treatments (treat, hospitalization), and psychological factors (such as cesd score, mcs, pcs). The dataset provides details like the number of days since a participant last used substances, their risk levels, treatment history, average and maximum number of drinks consumed, and hospitalization incidents. It includes a mix of categorical and numeric data, offering a comprehensive look at factors relevant to participants’ treatment and health risks.\n\n\n\n\nHELPrct %&gt;% \n  gf_bar(~substance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the distribution of primary substances of abuse among the participants in the dataset. The three substances depicted are alcohol, cocaine, and heroin. Alcohol has the highest count, with over 150 participants primarily abusing it. Cocaine comes next, followed by heroin, which has the lowest count among the three substances. This suggests that alcohol abuse is more prevalent among the participants compared to cocaine and heroin.\n\n\n\n\nHELPrct %&gt;%\n  gf_props(~substance, fill=~sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis displays the proportion of male and female participants who primarily abuse alcohol, cocaine, or heroin. Each bar is divided to represent the proportion of males (shown in blue) and females (shown in red) for each substance. For alcohol and heroin, males make up a larger portion of the abusers, whereas cocaine has a more balanced proportion between males and females. Overall, more males than females are represented across all three substances of abuse.\n\n\n\n\napartments &lt;- read_csv(\"../../data/apartments.csv\")\n\nRows: 1460 Columns: 1\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): GrLivArea;SalePrice\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\napartments\n\n# A tibble: 1,460 × 1\n   `GrLivArea;SalePrice`\n   &lt;chr&gt;                \n 1 1710;208500          \n 2 1262;181500          \n 3 1786;223500          \n 4 1717;140000          \n 5 2198;250000          \n 6 1362;143000          \n 7 1694;307000          \n 8 2090;200000          \n 9 1774;129900          \n10 1077;118000          \n# ℹ 1,450 more rows\n\n\nThe dataset combines two attributes-living area and sale price in each row, allowing for analysis of how living space correlates with the sale price across different apartments.\n\n\n\n\napartments &lt;- read_delim(file=\"../../data/apartments.csv\",delim =\";\")\n\nRows: 1460 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \";\"\ndbl (2): GrLivArea, SalePrice\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThe dataset is read using a semicolon (;) delimiter.\n\n\n\n\napartments\n\n# A tibble: 1,460 × 2\n   GrLivArea SalePrice\n       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1      1710    208500\n 2      1262    181500\n 3      1786    223500\n 4      1717    140000\n 5      2198    250000\n 6      1362    143000\n 7      1694    307000\n 8      2090    200000\n 9      1774    129900\n10      1077    118000\n# ℹ 1,450 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\napartments %&gt;% \n  head(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   GrLivArea SalePrice\n       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1      1710    208500\n 2      1262    181500\n 3      1786    223500\n 4      1717    140000\n 5      2198    250000\n 6      1362    143000\n 7      1694    307000\n 8      2090    200000\n 9      1774    129900\n10      1077    118000\n\n\nThe first 10 rows of the apartments dataset provide details of apartments based on two key variables: GrLivArea (above-ground living area in square feet) and SalePrice (the sale price in US dollars).

The age of individuals in the dataset ranges from 21 to 35 years, with a mean of approximately 30. The work variable ranges from 0 to 52, with a mean value of around 19, indicating a spread of work hours or some related measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrowname (dbl): The index or row number of the dataset.\nage (dbl): The age of individuals in the dataset.\nwork (dbl): The number of years the individuals have worked.\n\n\n\n\n\nmorekids (chr): Indicates whether the individual has more kids (e.g., yes, no).\ngender1 (chr): The gender of the individual (e.g., male, female).\ngender2 (chr): Another column representing gender (e.g., male, female).\nafam (chr): Indicates African American status (e.g., yes, no).\nhispanic (chr): Indicates Hispanic ethnicity (e.g., yes, no).\nother (chr): Indicates whether the individual belongs to another ethnic group (e.g., yes, no).\n\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ age, data = fert, bins = 30, fill = \"purple\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Age\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of ages in the fertility dataset shows that the majority of individuals fall between the ages of 25 and 35. There is a noticeable peak around the ages of 30 to 33, where the count of individuals reaches its highest point. The dataset contains fewer individuals under the age of 25 and over the age of 35, indicating a concentration of respondents in their late 20s to early 30s. This histogram suggests that the dataset primarily includes individuals in this middle age range, which could be typical for studies related to fertility.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ morekids, data = fert, fill = \"lightgreen\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"More Children\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Proportion of Individuals with More Children\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA larger portion of individuals, over 150,000, indicated that they do not have more children, while a smaller group, approximately 100,000, reported having more children. This indicates that the majority of respondents do not have additional children compared to those who do. The distribution suggests a notable difference between the two groups, with fewer individuals opting for more children.\n\n\n\n\ngf_histogram(~ work, data = fert, bins = 20, fill = \"orange\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Work Hours\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Work Hours\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram illustrates the distribution of work hours across individuals. A significant proportion of the individuals report zero work hours, as seen by the large spike at the beginning of the graph. There are also smaller groups of individuals with higher work hours, particularly around the 40-hour mark, which is typically considered a full-time workload. This suggests that many individuals in the dataset do not work, while those who do often work around 40 hours per week. The distribution is heavily skewed toward the lower end of the work hours scale.\n\n\n\n\ngf_props(~ gender1, data = fert, fill = \"lightblue\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Gender 1\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Gender 1 Distribution\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngf_props(~ gender2, data = fert, fill = \"darkblue\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Gender 2\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Gender 2 Distribution\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fertility dataset presents a balanced distribution of genders across both the Gender 1 and Gender 2 categories. In both groups, males and females are represented almost equally, as shown by the bar charts. The proportion of males in Gender 1 is slightly higher at 51.4%, while the proportion of females is 48.6%. Similarly, in Gender 2, the male proportion is 51.3%, with females comprising 48.7%. This even distribution highlights that gender representation is fairly uniform within the dataset, providing a balanced basis for further analysis regarding gender-related variables.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ afam, data = fert, fill = \"lightpink\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"African American\", y = \"Count\", title = \"African American Status Distribution\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ hispanic, data = fert, fill = \"violet\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Hispanic\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Hispanic Status Distribution\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two graphs show the distribution of African American and Hispanic statuses within the dataset. For both variables, the majority of individuals are classified as “no,” indicating they are not African American or Hispanic, while a smaller proportion is classified as “yes,” indicating they are. This suggests that the dataset has a relatively low representation of both African American and Hispanic individuals."

The distance of rides ranges from 0 to 42.3 miles, with a mean of 6.22 miles, and the hour variable represents the time of day, ranging from 0 to 23.\n\n\n\n\nskim(taxi)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\ntaxi\n\n\nNumber of rows\n10000\n\n\nNumber of columns\n8\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n5\n\n\nnumeric\n3\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\ntip\n0\n1\n2\n3\n0\n2\n0\n\n\ncompany\n0\n1\n5\n28\n0\n7\n0\n\n\nlocal\n0\n1\n2\n3\n0\n2\n0\n\n\ndow\n0\n1\n3\n3\n0\n7\n0\n\n\nmonth\n0\n1\n3\n3\n0\n4\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nrownames\n0\n1\n5000.50\n2886.90\n1\n2500.75\n5000.50\n7500.25\n10000.0\n▇▇▇▇▇\n\n\ndistance\n0\n1\n6.22\n7.38\n0\n0.94\n1.78\n15.56\n42.3\n▇▁▂▁▁\n\n\nhour\n0\n1\n14.18\n4.36\n0\n11.00\n15.00\n18.00\n23.0\n▁▃▅▇▃\n\n\n\n\n\nThis summary provides a detailed breakdown of the dataset’s completeness and distribution, making it well-prepared for further analysis.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified &lt;- taxi %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    local = factor(local,\n      levels = c(\"no\", \"yes\"),\n      labels = c(\"no\", \"yes\"),\n      ordered = TRUE\n    ),\n    dow = factor(dow,\n      levels = c(\"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\"),\n      labels = c(\"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\"),\n      ordered = TRUE\n    ),\n    month = factor(month,\n      levels = c(\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\"),\n      labels = c(\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\"),\n      ordered = TRUE\n    )\n  )\nglimpse(taxi_modified)\n\nRows: 10,000\nColumns: 8\n$ rownames &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18…\n$ tip      &lt;chr&gt; \"yes\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"yes\"…\n$ distance &lt;dbl&gt; 17.19, 0.88, 18.11, 20.70, 12.23, 0.94, 17.47, 17.67, 1.85, 1…\n$ company  &lt;chr&gt; \"Chicago Independents\", \"City Service\", \"other\", \"Chicago Ind…\n$ local    &lt;ord&gt; no, yes, no, no, no, yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes, no…\n$ dow      &lt;ord&gt; Thu, Thu, Mon, Mon, Sun, Sat, Fri, Sun, Fri, Tue, Tue, Sun, W…\n$ month    &lt;ord&gt; Feb, Mar, Feb, Apr, Mar, Apr, Mar, Jan, Apr, Mar, Mar, Apr, A…\n$ hour     &lt;dbl&gt; 16, 8, 18, 8, 21, 23, 12, 6, 12, 14, 18, 11, 12, 19, 17, 13, …\n\n\nThis modified version of the taxi dataset includes the conversion of several variables into factors with ordered levels. Specifically, the variables local, dow, and month have been converted into factors. Each has been assigned specific ordered levels. The local variable indicates whether a ride was local (“no” or “yes”), while dow is now ordered from Monday to Sunday, and month from January to April. This change improves the dataset for analysis where the natural order of days and months is important, making it easier to perform time-based analyses or comparisons.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 1A: Counts of Tips\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# gf_labs- Metadata about the graph\n\nThe bar chart titled “Counts of Tips” displays the frequency of taxi rides where a tip was given versus those where no tip was provided. The chart shows a significantly higher count of rides where a tip was given, with over 7,500 rides including a tip, compared to a much smaller count of rides without a tip, which is under 1,000. This indicates that the majority of taxi rides in this dataset included a tip.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~tip,\n    colour = ~local,\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 2A: Colour Bar Chart\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# colour-outline colour\n\nThis colour-coded bar chart titled “Plot 2A: Colour Bar Chart” displays the count of taxi rides where a tip was given or not, with an additional distinction based on whether the ride was local or not. The darker bars represent non-local rides, while the lighter-coloured edges represent local rides.From the chart, it is clear that the majority of taxi rides where a tip was given were non-local, as the darker colour dominates the “yes” category. Similarly, for rides without a tip, the majority are also non-local. There are relatively few local rides, indicated by the lighter-coloured edges, in both the tip and no-tip categories.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~tip,\n    fill = ~local,\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 2B: Stacked Bar Chart\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# fill- fill the bar with a colour or variable\n\nThis stacked bar chart titled “Plot 2B: Stacked Bar Chart” shows the distribution of taxi rides based on whether a tip was given, with the additional breakdown of local and non-local rides. The purple sections represent non-local rides, while the yellow sections represent local rides. In the “yes” category (rides with a tip), most of the rides are non-local (purple), with a smaller portion being local (yellow). Similarly, in the “no” category (rides without a tip), the majority are also non-local rides.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~tip,\n    fill = ~local,\n    position = \"dodge\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 2C: Dodged Bar Chart\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis “Dodged Bar Chart” (Plot 2C) provides a side-by-side comparison of taxi rides where tips were given or not, categorized by whether the ride was local or non-local. The purple bars represent non-local rides, and the yellow bars represent local rides.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~tip,\n    fill = ~local,\n    position = \"fill\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 2D: Filled Bar Chart\",\n    subtitle = \"Shows Per group differences in Proportions!\"\n  )# position = \"fill\"- Used for proportions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis “Filled Bar Chart” (Plot 2D) shows the proportion of local and non-local taxi rides for both the tipping and non-tipping categories. The purple colour represents non-local rides, and the yellow colour represents local rides.This chart emphasizes the relative proportion of local versus non-local rides rather than the absolute counts, making it useful for understanding the distribution of ride types across tipping behaviour.\n\n\n\n\ntaxi_modified %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~company, fill = ~tip, position = \"fill\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 3A: Proportion of taxi rides where tips were given or not, broken down by different taxi companies\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis “Filled Bar Chart” (Plot 3A) displays the proportion of taxi rides where tips were given or not, broken down by different taxi companies. The blue segments represent rides where tips were given, and the red segments represent rides without tips. From the chart, it is clear that for all companies, the majority of rides resulted in a tip, while the non-tipping rides make up a smaller proportion across all companies. Some companies, like “Flash Cab,” have a slightly larger proportion of non-tipping rides compared to others, but overall, tipping is the dominant behaviour for all the companies displayed. This chart emphasizes the tipping pattern across different taxi providers, showing relatively consistent behaviour.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~hour, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 4: Counts of Tips by Hour\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Counts of Tips by Hour” chart shows the distribution of taxi rides and tipping behaviour throughout the day. The number of rides increases steadily during the morning, peaks between 2 PM and 4 PM, and then declines in the evening. Most rides result in a tip, as indicated by the large blue bars across all hours, with a smaller proportion of non-tipping rides (red bars). The highest concentration of rides and tips occurs during the afternoon hours, while early morning and late evening see fewer rides overall. This pattern highlights that tipping is consistent throughout the day, especially during peak ride times.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~dow, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 5: Counts of Tips by Day of Week\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Counts of Tips by Day of Week” chart shows the number of taxi rides and tipping behaviour across different days of the week. Thursdays have the highest number of rides, followed by Wednesdays, while the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) have the lowest ride counts. Across all days, most rides result in a tip, as indicated by the blue bars. A small portion of rides, particularly on weekdays, do not result in a tip, shown by the red bars. Overall, tipping behavior is consistent throughout the week, but ride volumes peak midweek and decrease during the weekend.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~month, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 6: Counts of Tips by Month\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the distribution of taxi rides and tipping behaviour over the months of January through April. March and April show the highest ride counts, both exceeding 3,000 rides, with a significant majority of these rides resulting in tips. February has a moderate number of rides, slightly lower than March and April, but tipping behavior remains strong. January has the fewest rides, but similarly, most rides result in tips. Overall, tipping appears consistent across all four months, with a clear trend of most taxi rides receiving tips, regardless of the month.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ month | dow, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Plot 7: Counts of Tips by Day of Week and Month\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multi-faceted bar chart depicts the counts of taxi rides and tipping patterns across different days of the week (Monday to Sunday) and months (January to April). For most days of the week, March and April show higher counts of rides compared to January and February. Thursdays and Fridays have the highest ride counts, with a strong tendency toward tipping, particularly in March and April. Sundays generally have the fewest rides but maintain a steady tipping trend. Overall, tipping behaviour remains consistent across different days, with the majority of rides receiving tips, especially as the year progresses into spring months.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ dow | hour, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 8A: Counts of Tips by Hour and Day of Week\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart shows the distribution of taxi rides and tipping behaviour across different hours of the day and days of the week. Tipping generally follows a similar pattern throughout the week, with the highest ride counts and tips occurring between 8 AM and 6 PM, particularly around midday. Monday through Friday sees more rides, with a peak tipping period from 8 AM to 3 PM. The early morning and late evening hours (before 7 AM and after 9 PM) have significantly fewer rides and tips. Weekends, especially Sundays, show lower overall ride and tipping activity throughout all hours of the day.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ dow | hour, fill = ~tip, position =\"fill\", data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 8B: Proportions of Tips by Hour and Day of Week\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart visualizes the proportion of taxi rides that result in tips across different hours of the day ( segregated as multiple graphs) and days of the week ( x-axis). The consistent blue (representing tips) across most hours and days suggests that a large majority of rides result in tipping, regardless of the time or day. However, some fluctuations occur, particularly during early morning hours (2 AM - 5 AM) on weekdays, when the percentage of rides without tips (in red) increases slightly. Despite these minor variations, tipping appears to be a regular part of most rides across all hours and days.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ hour | dow, fill = ~tip, data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 9: Counts of Tips by Hour and Day of Week\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart illustrates the distribution of taxi rides that resulted in tips across different hours of the day (x-axis) for each day of the week( shown as different graphs). The data reveals that tipping patterns are fairly consistent throughout the week, with peak hours for tipping occurring in the late morning to afternoon (around 9 AM to 3 PM). The chart also shows that there are fewer rides without tips (in red) during these peak hours, while early morning and late-night hours, especially on weekends, tend to have a smaller proportion of tipping. Thursdays and Fridays appear to have the highest number of taxi rides with tips.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~hour, fill = ~tip, position =\"fill\", data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 10: Counts of Tips by Hour\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart illustrates the proportion of taxi rides that resulted in tips (in blue) versus no tips (in red) across different hours of the day. The majority of taxi rides during all hours tend to result in a tip, as indicated by the dominant blue colour in the chart. There is a slightly higher proportion of rides without tips in the early morning (around 1 AM to 5 AM) and later in the night, but overall, tipping remains consistent throughout the day, with a slight dip in tip occurrences during off-peak hours.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~dow, fill = ~tip, position =\"fill\", data = taxi_modified) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Plot 11: Counts of Tips by Day of Week\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart shows the proportion of taxi rides that received tips (in blue) versus no tips (in red) for each day of the week. Across all days, a majority of rides result in tips, as shown by the larger blue segments in each bar. The proportion of no-tips (red) remains fairly consistent throughout the week, with no significant differences between the days. This suggests that tipping behaviour is relatively uniform, regardless of the day of the week.\n\n\n\n\ndata(\"HELPrct\")\nHELPrct\n\n    age anysubstatus anysub cesd  d1 daysanysub dayslink drugrisk

These variables include data related to demographic characteristics (like age, sex), substance use (such as anysub, daysanysub), risks (drugrisk, sexrisk), treatments (treat, hospitalization), and psychological factors (such as cesd score, mcs, pcs). The dataset provides details like the number of days since a participant last used substances, their risk levels, treatment history, average and maximum number of drinks consumed, and hospitalization incidents. It includes a mix of categorical and numeric data, offering a comprehensive look at factors relevant to participants’ treatment and health risks.\n\n\n\n\nHELPrct %&gt;% \n  gf_bar(~substance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the distribution of primary substances of abuse among the participants in the dataset. The three substances depicted are alcohol, cocaine, and heroin. Alcohol has the highest count, with over 150 participants primarily abusing it. Cocaine comes next, followed by heroin, which has the lowest count among the three substances. This suggests that alcohol abuse is more prevalent among the participants compared to cocaine and heroin.\n\n\n\n\nHELPrct %&gt;%\n  gf_props(~substance, fill=~sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis displays the proportion of male and female participants who primarily abuse alcohol, cocaine, or heroin. Each bar is divided to represent the proportion of males (shown in blue) and females (shown in red) for each substance. For alcohol and heroin, males make up a larger portion of the abusers, whereas cocaine has a more balanced proportion between males and females. Overall, more males than females are represented across all three substances of abuse.\n\n\n\n\napartments &lt;- read_csv(\"../../data/apartments.csv\")\n\nRows: 1460 Columns: 1\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): GrLivArea;SalePrice\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\napartments\n\n# A tibble: 1,460 × 1\n   `GrLivArea;SalePrice`\n   &lt;chr&gt;                \n 1 1710;208500          \n 2 1262;181500          \n 3 1786;223500          \n 4 1717;140000          \n 5 2198;250000          \n 6 1362;143000          \n 7 1694;307000          \n 8 2090;200000          \n 9 1774;129900          \n10 1077;118000          \n# ℹ 1,450 more rows\n\n\nThe dataset combines two attributes-living area and sale price in each row, allowing for analysis of how living space correlates with the sale price across different apartments.\n\n\n\n\napartments &lt;- read_delim(file=\"../../data/apartments.csv\",delim =\";\")\n\nRows: 1460 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \";\"\ndbl (2): GrLivArea, SalePrice\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThe dataset is read using a semicolon (;) delimiter.\n\n\n\n\napartments\n\n# A tibble: 1,460 × 2\n   GrLivArea SalePrice\n       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1      1710    208500\n 2      1262    181500\n 3      1786    223500\n 4      1717    140000\n 5      2198    250000\n 6      1362    143000\n 7      1694    307000\n 8      2090    200000\n 9      1774    129900\n10      1077    118000\n# ℹ 1,450 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\napartments %&gt;% \n  head(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   GrLivArea SalePrice\n       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1      1710    208500\n 2      1262    181500\n 3      1786    223500\n 4      1717    140000\n 5      2198    250000\n 6      1362    143000\n 7      1694    307000\n 8      2090    200000\n 9      1774    129900\n10      1077    118000\n\n\nThe first 10 rows of the apartments dataset provide details of apartments based on two key variables: GrLivArea (above-ground living area in square feet) and SalePrice (the sale price in US dollars).

The age of individuals in the dataset ranges from 21 to 35 years, with a mean of approximately 30. The work variable ranges from 0 to 52, with a mean value of around 19, indicating a spread of work hours or some related measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrowname (dbl): The index or row number of the dataset.\nage (dbl): The age of individuals in the dataset.\nwork (dbl): The number of years the individuals have worked.\n\n\n\n\n\nmorekids (chr): Indicates whether the individual has more kids (e.g., yes, no).\ngender1 (chr): The gender of the individual (e.g., male, female).\ngender2 (chr): Another column representing gender (e.g., male, female).\nafam (chr): Indicates African American status (e.g., yes, no).\nhispanic (chr): Indicates Hispanic ethnicity (e.g., yes, no).\nother (chr): Indicates whether the individual belongs to another ethnic group (e.g., yes, no).\n\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ age, data = fert, bins = 30, fill = \"purple\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Age\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of ages in the fertility dataset shows that the majority of individuals fall between the ages of 25 and 35. There is a noticeable peak around the ages of 30 to 33, where the count of individuals reaches its highest point. The dataset contains fewer individuals under the age of 25 and over the age of 35, indicating a concentration of respondents in their late 20s to early 30s. This histogram suggests that the dataset primarily includes individuals in this middle age range, which could be typical for studies related to fertility.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ morekids, data = fert, fill = \"lightgreen\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"More Children\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Proportion of Individuals with More Children\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA larger portion of individuals, over 150,000, indicated that they do not have more children, while a smaller group, approximately 100,000, reported having more children. This indicates that the majority of respondents do not have additional children compared to those who do. The distribution suggests a notable difference between the two groups, with fewer individuals opting for more children.\n\n\n\n\ngf_histogram(~ work, data = fert, bins = 20, fill = \"orange\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Work Hours\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Work Hours\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram illustrates the distribution of work hours across individuals. A significant proportion of the individuals report zero work hours, as seen by the large spike at the beginning of the graph. There are also smaller groups of individuals with higher work hours, particularly around the 40-hour mark, which is typically considered a full-time workload. This suggests that many individuals in the dataset do not work, while those who do often work around 40 hours per week. The distribution is heavily skewed toward the lower end of the work hours scale.\n\n\n\n\ngf_props(~ gender1, data = fert, fill = \"lightblue\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Gender 1\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Gender 1 Distribution\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngf_props(~ gender2, data = fert, fill = \"darkblue\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Gender 2\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Gender 2 Distribution\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fertility dataset presents a balanced distribution of genders across both the Gender 1 and Gender 2 categories. In both groups, males and females are represented almost equally, as shown by the bar charts. The proportion of males in Gender 1 is slightly higher at 51.4%, while the proportion of females is 48.6%. Similarly, in Gender 2, the male proportion is 51.3%, with females comprising 48.7%. This even distribution highlights that gender representation is fairly uniform within the dataset, providing a balanced basis for further analysis regarding gender-related variables.\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ afam, data = fert, fill = \"lightpink\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"African American\", y = \"Count\", title = \"African American Status Distribution\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngf_bar(~ hispanic, data = fert, fill = \"violet\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Hispanic\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Hispanic Status Distribution\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two graphs show the distribution of African American and Hispanic statuses within the dataset. For both variables, the majority of individuals are classified as “no,” indicating they are not African American or Hispanic, while a smaller proportion is classified as “yes,” indicating they are. This suggests that the dataset has a relatively low representation of both African American and Hispanic individuals."

The peak was in 2008, when 203 baby girls were named Aditi, accounting for 0.0009755 of all female births that year. After 2008, the name’s popularity varied slightly but remained fairly stable, with a gradual decline in the following years. By 2017, 127 baby girls were named Aditi, representing 0.0006774 of female births.\n\n\n\n\nbabynames %&gt;% filter(name==\"Aditi\") %&gt;% \n  gf_line(n~year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line graph shows the trend in the popularity of the name “Aditi” for baby girls in the United States from 1977 to 2017.

Neither name appeared in the U.S. dataset from 1880 to 1999, and both first emerged in 1999 with very low occurrences. However, “Khushi” quickly became more popular, while “Kushi” remained relatively rare. By 2003, 178 baby girls were named “Khushi,” compared to just 9 named “Kushi,” and this pattern persisted in the following years. Overall, “Khushi” consistently saw higher usage, demonstrating how different spellings of the same name can experience varying levels of adoption over time.\n\n\n\n\nbabynames %&gt;% filter(name==\"Khushi\"| name==\"Kushi\") %&gt;% \n  gf_line(n~year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line graph illustrates the trend in the popularity of the names “Khushi” and “Kushi” for baby girls in the U.S. from 1999 to 2017.

No missing values were reported for any of the variables except wage_percent_of_male, which has eight missing entries. The numeric variables like total_workers have a mean of 204,967.1 and a median of 89,784, while the standard deviation is quite high, indicating significant variation in the total number of workers across different occupations. The distribution of workers and their earnings, particularly between males and females, highlights differences in wages, with wage_percent_of_male indicating that females generally earn 85.8% of what males do on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntotal_workers (dbl): The total number of workers in the specified occupation.\nworkers_male (dbl): The number of male workers in the specified occupation.\nworkers_female (dbl): The number of female workers in the specified occupation.\npercent_female (dbl): The percentage of female workers in the specified occupation.\ntotal_earnings (dbl): The total earnings of all workers in the specified occupation.\ntotal_earnings_male (dbl): The total earnings of male workers in the specified occupation.\ntotal_earnings_female (dbl): The total earnings of female workers in the specified occupation.\nwage_percent_of_male (dbl): The percentage of female earnings relative to male earnings in the specified occupation.\nyear (dbl): The year during which the data was collected.\n\n\n\n\n\noccupation (chr): The specific job or profession.\nmajor_category (chr): The broad category to which the occupation belongs.\nminor_category (chr): The sub-category within the major category of the occupation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWage Percent of Male\nThis is the key outcome of interest in the job_gender dataset as it indicates the earnings of female workers compared to male workers. Understanding this ratio can help assess the gender pay gap within different occupations. The goal of the analysis could be to identify the factors that influence wage disparity between male and female workers in various occupations.\nThe Wage Percent of Male is considered the target variable, rather than Percent Female, because it directly addresses the earnings gap between genders. Wage Percent of Male captures the outcome that most directly relates to gender pay gaps, making it the target variable for an analysis focused on wage equality. Percent Female, though important, only gives a snapshot of workforce composition and does not measure the disparity in pay.\n\n\n\n\nTotal Workers\nThe total number of workers in an occupation might impact wage distribution. A larger workforce could lead to more standardized wages, whereas smaller, specialized occupations may have more variation in pay.\nWorkers Male\nThe number of male workers in an occupation might be a predictor of wage levels, particularly if certain occupations are male-dominated.\nWorkers Female\nSimilarly, the number of female workers in an occupation might influence wage structures, especially in occupations that are traditionally female-dominated.\nPercent Female\nThis variable reflects the percentage of females in the workforce and can help determine if occupations with a higher proportion of female workers tend to have lower wages compared to male-dominated fields.\nTotal Earnings\nThe overall earnings in an occupation may indicate the earning potential, which could vary depending on how well the occupation is compensated regardless of gender.\nTotal Earnings Male\nThis variable represents the total earnings of male workers, which could provide insight into wage differences when compared to female earnings.\nTotal Earnings Female\nThe total earnings of female workers can be used to analyze how women’s pay compares to that of men within the same occupation.\nYear\nThe year the data was collected might reflect economic conditions, labor market trends, or changes in gender wage equality over time.\nOccupation\nThe specific job or profession can play a significant role in determining wage differences, as some occupations tend to have higher wage disparities than others.\n\n\n\n\nThe main objective of this research experiment could be to analyze and explore potential wage disparities between male and female workers across various occupations. The study might aim to understand how gender could affect earnings within different industries and roles, and what factors might contribute to wage inequality between male and female workers.\nSeveral hypotheses could have been proposed:\n\nThere could be a significant wage disparity between male and female workers in many occupations, where women might generally earn less than men for the same role.\nThe proportion of female workers in an occupation could influence wage disparity, with occupations having higher percentages of female workers potentially showing greater wage inequality.\nHigher-paying occupations could demonstrate larger wage gaps between male and female workers.\n\nThe study sampled various occupations across different industries, ensuring representation from male-dominated, female-dominated, and gender-balanced fields. The sample included both public and private sector workers, and data was stratified by occupation to allow for specific analysis of each role.\nData Collection:\n\nPrimary Data Source: Employment and salary data could have been collected from government labor statistics databases, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), or other relevant sources. Surveys might have been conducted across various industries to gather detailed wage and gender data for different occupations.\nSurvey Design: Structured surveys or administrative data might have been used to capture information about employee salaries, gender, and occupation. Employers or government agencies could have provided the data, which would then have been anonymized and aggregated by occupation.\n\nSampling:\n\nThe study might have sampled a range of occupations across different industries, ensuring representation from male-dominated, female-dominated, and gender-balanced fields. The sample could have included both public and private sector workers, with data stratified by occupation to allow for specific analysis of each role.\n\nCalculation of Variables:\n\nWage Percent of Male was calculated by dividing the average salary of female workers by the average salary of male workers for each occupation.\nPercent Female was calculated as the number of female workers divided by the total number of workers in each occupation.\n\nThe experiment could aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of gender wage gaps across industries, potentially identifying which occupations exhibit the largest disparities and what factors (such as gender representation and occupation type) might contribute to wage inequality.\n\n\n\n\njob_gender &lt;- job_gender %&gt;%\n

resolve the issue with the data showing 0 percent on the x-axis. Despite multiple attempts—ranging from adjusting the scale, specifying limits, mutating the percentage data, and setting breaks—nothing seemed to work. Each attempt either resulted in all the percentages remaining at 0 or caused the percentages to disappear entirely. Even when I tried different methods, the numbers on the axis shifted, and I still couldn’t get the correct percentages to display. It’s been frustrating, as no matter what I tried, the issue persists, and I haven’t been able to resolve it.\n\n\n\nThe graph titled “Salaries and Gender Proportion in the Workforce” seeks to answer the following questions:\n1.What is the relationship between salary levels and the proportion of females in various occupations?\n( The graph could aim to explore whether occupations with a higher percentage of female workers tend to offer lower salaries compared to male-dominated fields.)\n\nIn the dataset, there seems to be a trend where occupations with a higher proportion of female workers tend to offer lower average salaries. For example, jobs such as elementary school teachers (where females represent a large portion of the workforce) have relatively lower wages compared to male-dominated fields like engineering or management, where salaries are significantly higher. This suggests a negative relationship between the proportion of female workers and salary levels.\n\n2.How does gender representation in the workforce affect wage distribution across different job categories?\n( It may seek to analyze whether there is a noticeable correlation between the gender composition of an occupation and the wage gap, specifically examining how gender representation impacts salary levels in different sectors.)\n\nThe data shows that occupations with more male representation tend to have higher salaries. For example, industries such as construction and technology, which are male-dominated, tend to have higher wages. On the other hand, female-dominated fields like healthcare support or administrative services exhibit lower wage levels, indicating a wage gap between gender representation in different sectors.\n\n3.Which occupations exhibit significant disparities between the proportion of female workers and their salary levels?\n( The graph could identify which job categories have high female representation but lower salaries, highlighting potential areas of gender-based wage inequality.)\n\nA significant disparity is observed in roles like nursing, where there is a high proportion of female workers but relatively lower average salaries. Conversely, in occupations such as executive management, which have a low proportion of female workers, the wages are considerably higher. This highlights the wage inequality that exists in certain sectors despite high female representation.\n\n4.Do certain industries show a trend of higher wages for occupations with fewer female workers?\n( It may seek to explore whether male-dominated industries offer higher wages compared to female-dominated ones, pointing to the potential for occupational segregation to influence income inequality.)\n\nYes, industries such as engineering and technology, which are male-dominated, display higher wages. The data indicates that male-dominated fields tend to offer better pay compared to female-dominated occupations, suggesting occupational segregation and its impact on wages.\n\n5.Is there evidence of gender wage gaps in high-paying versus low-paying occupations?\n( The graph could aim to determine whether high-paying jobs are more prone to gender wage gaps compared to lower-paying ones, and how these gaps manifest across different sectors.)\n\nYes, high-paying occupations such as executive management and engineering have a noticeable gender wage gap, with male workers dominating these fields and receiving higher salaries. On the other hand, lower-paying fields like nursing or teaching—which have a higher proportion of female workers—show relatively smaller wage gaps but also lower overall salaries.\n\n\n\n\n1.What kind of chart is used in the figure?\nThe chart is a bubble plot (or scatter plot with size variation), where each bubble represents an occupation. The size of the bubbles typically corresponds to the number of workers in that occupation, while the x-axis represents salaries, and the y-axis shows the proportion of female workers in those occupations.\n2.What geometries have been used, and to which variables have these geometries been mapped?\nThe key geometries used in this bubble plot are:\n\nPoints (bubbles): Represent occupations.\nX-axis: Mapped to salaries (salary levels).\nY-axis: Mapped to the proportion of female workers in each occupation.\nSize of bubbles: Mapped to the number of workers in each occupation.\n\n3.Based on this graph, do you think gender plays a role in salaries? What is the trend you see?\nYes, gender seems to play a significant role in salaries. The trend observed is that occupations with higher proportions of female workers tend to have lower salaries. For example, professions dominated by women (e.g., nursing, teaching) exhibit relatively smaller salaries compared to male-dominated fields like engineering or executive management, which have higher wages. This suggests a gender wage gap where male-dominated occupations offer higher pay compared to female-dominated ones.\n4.If SALARY, NO_OF_WORKERS, GENDER, OCCUPATION were available in the original dataset, what pre-processing would have been necessary to obtain this plot?\nSeveral preprocessing steps would likely be necessary:\n\nConversion of Salary Data: Depending on the scale of salary values, some conversion to a common currency/scale might be required for better comparison.\nGender Proportion Calculation: The dataset would need to compute the proportion of female workers (e.g., percentage of female workers relative to the total number of workers in each occupation).\nHandling Missing Data: Any missing data in variables such as salary or number of workers would need to be addressed.\nSize Mapping: The number of workers would need to be scaled to appropriately map the bubble sizes in the plot, ensuring large and small values are distinguishable.\nAggregating Data: If the data included detailed information about individual workers, it might have been grouped by occupation. This would involve calculating summary statistics such as the average salary, the percentage of female workers, and the total number of workers for each job type.\n\n\n\n\nThe graph titled “Salaries and Gender Proportion in the Workforce” provides an insightful view into the relationship between gender proportions in various occupations and the corresponding salary disparities. By analyzing this data, we gain a deeper understanding of how gender representation in the workforce influences salary distribution across different job sectors.\n\n\n\nFrom analyzing the graph and the associated job_gender dataset, I observed the following:\n\nGender Imbalance in High-Paying Jobs: Occupations with a higher proportion of male workers, such as engineering and technology, tend to have higher median salaries. This indicates that male-dominated industries are often associated with higher compensation, highlighting a disparity in salary distribution across different sectors.\nLower Salaries in Female-Dominated Occupations: On the other hand, jobs with a higher percentage of female workers, such as nursing, teaching, and clerical roles, show significantly lower median salaries. This suggests that occupations traditionally dominated by women often receive lower pay compared to male-dominated fields.\nWage Disparities in Gender-Balanced Roles: Even in occupations where gender representation is relatively balanced, such as healthcare and education, there is still a noticeable gap in median salaries. This reinforces the idea that salary disparity isn’t solely dependent on the proportion of gender but is also influenced by societal and occupational factors.\n\n\n\n\nIf I were to draw conclusions based on this data, it’s clear that gender continues to play a critical role in shaping salary structures across industries. Investments in gender equity, particularly in improving the salaries of female-dominated sectors, could help bridge the pay gap. Healthcare and education, where salaries remain lower despite more balanced gender representation, should be prioritized in any gender equality effort.\n\n\n\nEach sector provides different insights into the relationship between gender and salaries:\n\nMale-Dominated Occupations: Roles in engineering, manufacturing, and technology, which are predominantly occupied by men, not only exhibit higher salaries but also reflect the societal value placed on these professions. Addressing this imbalance by encouraging more women to enter these sectors could help reduce the gender pay gap.\nFemale-Dominated Occupations: Fields such as teaching, nursing, and clerical work are primarily composed of women and tend to have lower salaries. These industries need targeted strategies to increase wages and provide women with equal earning opportunities.\nGender-Balanced Occupations: Even in sectors like healthcare, where gender balance is closer, salary gaps still exist. This suggests that achieving gender parity in representation alone may not be enough to address the underlying pay disparity.\n\n\n\n\nThis graph effectively visualizes how gender proportions across different occupations impact salary structures, offering key insights for policymakers, businesses, and advocacy groups. The data highlights critical sectors where pay equity efforts should be directed, ensuring equal opportunities and fair compensation regardless of gender. This visualization allows for a more targeted approach to resolving wage disparities and fostering a more inclusive workforce."

No missing values were reported for any of the variables except wage_percent_of_male, which has eight missing entries. The numeric variables like total_workers have a mean of 204,967.1 and a median of 89,784, while the standard deviation is quite high, indicating significant variation in the total number of workers across different occupations. The distribution of workers and their earnings, particularly between males and females, highlights differences in wages, with wage_percent_of_male indicating that females generally earn 85.8% of what males do on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntotal_workers (dbl): The total number of workers in the specified occupation.\nworkers_male (dbl): The number of male workers in the specified occupation.\nworkers_female (dbl): The number of female workers in the specified occupation.\npercent_female (dbl): The percentage of female workers in the specified occupation.\ntotal_earnings (dbl): The total earnings of all workers in the specified occupation.\ntotal_earnings_male (dbl): The total earnings of male workers in the specified occupation.\ntotal_earnings_female (dbl): The total earnings of female workers in the specified occupation.\nwage_percent_of_male (dbl): The percentage of female earnings relative to male earnings in the specified occupation.\nyear (dbl): The year during which the data was collected.\n\n\n\n\n\noccupation (chr): The specific job or profession.\nmajor_category (chr): The broad category to which the occupation belongs.\nminor_category (chr): The sub-category within the major category of the occupation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWage Percent of Male\nThis is the key outcome of interest in the job_gender dataset as it indicates the earnings of female workers compared to male workers. Understanding this ratio can help assess the gender pay gap within different occupations. The goal of the analysis could be to identify the factors that influence wage disparity between male and female workers in various occupations.\nThe Wage Percent of Male is considered the target variable, rather than Percent Female, because it directly addresses the earnings gap between genders. Wage Percent of Male captures the outcome that most directly relates to gender pay gaps, making it the target variable for an analysis focused on wage equality. Percent Female, though important, only gives a snapshot of workforce composition and does not measure the disparity in pay.\n\n\n\n\nTotal Workers\nThe total number of workers in an occupation might impact wage distribution. A larger workforce could lead to more standardized wages, whereas smaller, specialized occupations may have more variation in pay.\nWorkers Male\nThe number of male workers in an occupation might be a predictor of wage levels, particularly if certain occupations are male-dominated.\nWorkers Female\nSimilarly, the number of female workers in an occupation might influence wage structures, especially in occupations that are traditionally female-dominated.\nPercent Female\nThis variable reflects the percentage of females in the workforce and can help determine if occupations with a higher proportion of female workers tend to have lower wages compared to male-dominated fields.\nTotal Earnings\nThe overall earnings in an occupation may indicate the earning potential, which could vary depending on how well the occupation is compensated regardless of gender.\nTotal Earnings Male\nThis variable represents the total earnings of male workers, which could provide insight into wage differences when compared to female earnings.\nTotal Earnings Female\nThe total earnings of female workers can be used to analyze how women’s pay compares to that of men within the same occupation.\nYear\nThe year the data was collected might reflect economic conditions, labor market trends, or changes in gender wage equality over time.\nOccupation\nThe specific job or profession can play a significant role in determining wage differences, as some occupations tend to have higher wage disparities than others.\n\n\n\n\nThe main objective of this research experiment could be to analyze and explore potential wage disparities between male and female workers across various occupations. The study might aim to understand how gender could affect earnings within different industries and roles, and what factors might contribute to wage inequality between male and female workers.\nSeveral hypotheses could have been proposed:\n\nThere could be a significant wage disparity between male and female workers in many occupations, where women might generally earn less than men for the same role.\nThe proportion of female workers in an occupation could influence wage disparity, with occupations having higher percentages of female workers potentially showing greater wage inequality.\nHigher-paying occupations could demonstrate larger wage gaps between male and female workers.\n\nThe study sampled various occupations across different industries, ensuring representation from male-dominated, female-dominated, and gender-balanced fields. The sample included both public and private sector workers, and data was stratified by occupation to allow for specific analysis of each role.\nData Collection:\n\nPrimary Data Source: Employment and salary data could have been collected from government labor statistics databases, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), or other relevant sources. Surveys might have been conducted across various industries to gather detailed wage and gender data for different occupations.\nSurvey Design: Structured surveys or administrative data might have been used to capture information about employee salaries, gender, and occupation. Employers or government agencies could have provided the data, which would then have been anonymized and aggregated by occupation.\n\nSampling:\n\nThe study might have sampled a range of occupations across different industries, ensuring representation from male-dominated, female-dominated, and gender-balanced fields. The sample could have included both public and private sector workers, with data stratified by occupation to allow for specific analysis of each role.\n\nCalculation of Variables:\n\nWage Percent of Male was calculated by dividing the average salary of female workers by the average salary of male workers for each occupation.\nPercent Female was calculated as the number of female workers divided by the total number of workers in each occupation.\n\nThe experiment could aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of gender wage gaps across industries, potentially identifying which occupations exhibit the largest disparities and what factors (such as gender representation and occupation type) might contribute to wage inequality.\n\n\n\n\njob_gender &lt;- job_gender %&gt;%\n

resolve the issue with the data showing 0 percent on the x-axis. Despite multiple attempts—ranging from adjusting the scale, specifying limits, mutating the percentage data, and setting breaks—nothing seemed to work. Each attempt either resulted in all the percentages remaining at 0 or caused the percentages to disappear entirely. Even when I tried different methods, the numbers on the axis shifted, and I still couldn’t get the correct percentages to display. It’s been frustrating, as no matter what I tried, the issue persists, and I haven’t been able to resolve it.\n\n\n\nThe graph titled “Salaries and Gender Proportion in the Workforce” seeks to answer the following questions:\n1.What is the relationship between salary levels and the proportion of females in various occupations?\n( The graph could aim to explore whether occupations with a higher percentage of female workers tend to offer lower salaries compared to male-dominated fields.)\n\nIn the dataset, there seems to be a trend where occupations with a higher proportion of female workers tend to offer lower average salaries. For example, jobs such as elementary school teachers (where females represent a large portion of the workforce) have relatively lower wages compared to male-dominated fields like engineering or management, where salaries are significantly higher. This suggests a negative relationship between the proportion of female workers and salary levels.\n\n2.How does gender representation in the workforce affect wage distribution across different job categories?\n( It may seek to analyze whether there is a noticeable correlation between the gender composition of an occupation and the wage gap, specifically examining how gender representation impacts salary levels in different sectors.)\n\nThe data shows that occupations with more male representation tend to have higher salaries. For example, industries such as construction and technology, which are male-dominated, tend to have higher wages. On the other hand, female-dominated fields like healthcare support or administrative services exhibit lower wage levels, indicating a wage gap between gender representation in different sectors.\n\n3.Which occupations exhibit significant disparities between the proportion of female workers and their salary levels?\n( The graph could identify which job categories have high female representation but lower salaries, highlighting potential areas of gender-based wage inequality.)\n\nA significant disparity is observed in roles like nursing, where there is a high proportion of female workers but relatively lower average salaries. Conversely, in occupations such as executive management, which have a low proportion of female workers, the wages are considerably higher. This highlights the wage inequality that exists in certain sectors despite high female representation.\n\n4.Do certain industries show a trend of higher wages for occupations with fewer female workers?\n( It may seek to explore whether male-dominated industries offer higher wages compared to female-dominated ones, pointing to the potential for occupational segregation to influence income inequality.)\n\nYes, industries such as engineering and technology, which are male-dominated, display higher wages. The data indicates that male-dominated fields tend to offer better pay compared to female-dominated occupations, suggesting occupational segregation and its impact on wages.\n\n5.Is there evidence of gender wage gaps in high-paying versus low-paying occupations?\n( The graph could aim to determine whether high-paying jobs are more prone to gender wage gaps compared to lower-paying ones, and how these gaps manifest across different sectors.)\n\nYes, high-paying occupations such as executive management and engineering have a noticeable gender wage gap, with male workers dominating these fields and receiving higher salaries. On the other hand, lower-paying fields like nursing or teaching—which have a higher proportion of female workers—show relatively smaller wage gaps but also lower overall salaries.\n\n\n\n\n1.What kind of chart is used in the figure?\nThe chart is a bubble plot (or scatter plot with size variation), where each bubble represents an occupation. The size of the bubbles typically corresponds to the number of workers in that occupation, while the x-axis represents salaries, and the y-axis shows the proportion of female workers in those occupations.\n2.What geometries have been used, and to which variables have these geometries been mapped?\nThe key geometries used in this bubble plot are:\n\nPoints (bubbles): Represent occupations.\nX-axis: Mapped to salaries (salary levels).\nY-axis: Mapped to the proportion of female workers in each occupation.\nSize of bubbles: Mapped to the number of workers in each occupation.\n\n3.Based on this graph, do you think gender plays a role in salaries? What is the trend you see?\nYes, gender seems to play a significant role in salaries. The trend observed is that occupations with higher proportions of female workers tend to have lower salaries. For example, professions dominated by women (e.g., nursing, teaching) exhibit relatively smaller salaries compared to male-dominated fields like engineering or executive management, which have higher wages. This suggests a gender wage gap where male-dominated occupations offer higher pay compared to female-dominated ones.\n4.If SALARY, NO_OF_WORKERS, GENDER, OCCUPATION were available in the original dataset, what pre-processing would have been necessary to obtain this plot?\nSeveral preprocessing steps would likely be necessary:\n\nConversion of Salary Data: Depending on the scale of salary values, some conversion to a common currency/scale might be required for better comparison.\nGender Proportion Calculation: The dataset would need to compute the proportion of female workers (e.g., percentage of female workers relative to the total number of workers in each occupation).\nHandling Missing Data: Any missing data in variables such as salary or number of workers would need to be addressed.\nSize Mapping: The number of workers would need to be scaled to appropriately map the bubble sizes in the plot, ensuring large and small values are distinguishable.\nAggregating Data: If the data included detailed information about individual workers, it might have been grouped by occupation. This would involve calculating summary statistics such as the average salary, the percentage of female workers, and the total number of workers for each job type.\n\n\n\n\nThe graph titled “Salaries and Gender Proportion in the Workforce” provides an insightful view into the relationship between gender proportions in various occupations and the corresponding salary disparities. By analyzing this data, we gain a deeper understanding of how gender representation in the workforce influences salary distribution across different job sectors.\n\n\n\nFrom analyzing the graph and the associated job_gender dataset, I observed the following:\n\nGender Imbalance in High-Paying Jobs: Occupations with a higher proportion of male workers, such as engineering and technology, tend to have higher median salaries. This indicates that male-dominated industries are often associated with higher compensation, highlighting a disparity in salary distribution across different sectors.\nLower Salaries in Female-Dominated Occupations: On the other hand, jobs with a higher percentage of female workers, such as nursing, teaching, and clerical roles, show significantly lower median salaries. This suggests that occupations traditionally dominated by women often receive lower pay compared to male-dominated fields.\nWage Disparities in Gender-Balanced Roles: Even in occupations where gender representation is relatively balanced, such as healthcare and education, there is still a noticeable gap in median salaries. This reinforces the idea that salary disparity isn’t solely dependent on the proportion of gender but is also influenced by societal and occupational factors.\n\n\n\n\nIf I were to draw conclusions based on this data, it’s clear that gender continues to play a critical role in shaping salary structures across industries. Investments in gender equity, particularly in improving the salaries of female-dominated sectors, could help bridge the pay gap. Healthcare and education, where salaries remain lower despite more balanced gender representation, should be prioritized in any gender equality effort.\n\n\n\nEach sector provides different insights into the relationship between gender and salaries:\n\nMale-Dominated Occupations: Roles in engineering, manufacturing, and technology, which are predominantly occupied by men, not only exhibit higher salaries but also reflect the societal value placed on these professions. Addressing this imbalance by encouraging more women to enter these sectors could help reduce the gender pay gap.\nFemale-Dominated Occupations: Fields such as teaching, nursing, and clerical work are primarily composed of women and tend to have lower salaries. These industries need targeted strategies to increase wages and provide women with equal earning opportunities.\nGender-Balanced Occupations: Even in sectors like healthcare, where gender balance is closer, salary gaps still exist. This suggests that achieving gender parity in representation alone may not be enough to address the underlying pay disparity.\n\n\n\n\nThis graph effectively visualizes how gender proportions across different occupations impact salary structures, offering key insights for policymakers, businesses, and advocacy groups. The data highlights critical sectors where pay equity efforts should be directed, ensuring equal opportunities and fair compensation regardless of gender. This visualization allows for a more targeted approach to resolving wage disparities and fostering a more inclusive workforce."

The domestic_gross shows a minimum of $0, a maximum of around $451.5 million, with a mean of $45.5 million, and a standard deviation of $58.53 million, suggesting that while some movies earned significantly, others did poorly. Similarly, worldwide_gross ranges from $423 to nearly $1.39 billion, with an average of $93.84 million and a high standard deviation of $138.95 million, highlighting the broad spread in international earnings. The profit_ratio has a huge range from 1.38e+10 to 4.31e+14, reflecting the varying degrees of profitability, with a mean around 4.32e+14. The decade variable covers the time span from the early 1900s, with a mean year of approximately 1998, and a standard deviation of 10.6, showing that most of the data comes from modern movies.\n\n\nData Dictionary\n\nQuantitative Data:\n\nproduction_budget (dbl): The amount of money spent on producing the movie.\ndomestic_gross (dbl): The total revenue generated by the movie in the domestic (U.S.) market.\nworldwide_gross (dbl): The total revenue generated by the movie worldwide.\nprofit_ratio (dbl): The ratio of the movie’s profit relative to its budget.\ndecade (dbl): The decade during which the movie was released, represented numerically.\n\n\n\nQualitative Data:\n\nrelease_date (date): The date when the movie was released.\nmovie (chr): The title of the movie.\ndistributor (chr): The name of the studio or company that distributed the movie.\nmpaa_rating (chr): The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating of the movie.\ngenre (chr): The genre or category of the movie.\n\n\n\n\nTarget Variable\nProfit Ratio\nThe profit ratio is a key outcome of interest because it measures the success or profitability of each movie relative to its production budget. This is the most logical target variable because it represents the business performance of the movies in financial terms. The goal of analysis could be to understand what factors influence the profitability of movies.\n\n\nPredictor Variables\n\nProduction Budget\nThe amount of money spent to produce a movie likely affects its profit ratio. Larger budgets may lead to higher production values, star power, or marketing, but may also increase the risk of lower profitability if the movie doesn’t perform well.\nDomestic Gross\nThe domestic box office earnings provide a direct measure of the movie’s success within its home country, which likely impacts the overall profitability.\nWorldwide Gross\nLike domestic gross, this variable represents the movie’s global earnings, which play a crucial role in determining profitability, especially for internationally successful films.\nDistributor\nDifferent distributors may have different levels of market reach, marketing budgets, and strategic capabilities, which could influence a movie’s success and profit ratio.\nMPAA Rating\nThe MPAA rating (e.g., PG, PG-13, R) affects the audience size and demographics. Certain ratings may limit a movie’s audience, which could affect its overall profitability.\nGenre\nDifferent genres attract different audience demographics, which could influence box office performance and profitability. Some genres might consistently perform better than others.\nRelease Date\nThe timing of a movie’s release (e.g., summer blockbuster season, holiday period) can significantly influence its box office performance, which may impact profitability.\nDecade\nThe decade provides a historical context. Movies released in different decades may face different market conditions (e.g., competition, audience preferences, economic conditions), influencing profitability.\n\n\n\nResearch Experiment to Investigate Movie Profitability\nThe objective of this research experiment could have been to explore the factors that potentially influence the profitability of movies. The study might have aimed to analyze how various variables related to movie production, such as budget, genre, distributor, and MPAA rating, as well as market performance indicators like domestic and worldwide gross earnings, could affect a movie’s profit ratio.\nSeveral hypotheses could have been proposed:\n\nMovies with higher production budgets might correlate with lower profit ratios, possibly due to the increased financial risk associated with larger budgets.\nCertain genres, such as action or adventure, could exhibit higher profit ratios compared to others like drama or comedy.\nFilms distributed by larger studios, such as Warner Bros. or Paramount Pictures, might show better financial performance than those handled by smaller distributors.\nMPAA ratings could also play a role in profitability, with R-rated films potentially drawing smaller audiences compared to PG or PG-13 rated films.\n\nThe dataset used for this study consists of 3,310 movies from 1936 to 2017. The sample includes data on production budgets, domestic and worldwide gross, distributors, MPAA ratings, genres, profit ratios, and the decade in which the movie was released.\nThe data could have been obtained from box office databases (e.g., Box Office Mojo, IMDb), industry reports, and public financial records of movie studios. Additional information such as MPAA ratings and genres could be sourced from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and film databases.\nLimitations:\n\nMissing Data: Some movies may have incomplete data (e.g., missing MPAA ratings or gross earnings), which could affect the robustness of conclusions.\nExternal Factors: The dataset may not account for external factors like economic downturns, marketing spend, or competition from other media during the release window, all of which could impact profitability.\nHistorical Bias: Older movies may have different box office reporting practices, and inflation was likely accounted for in calculating the profit ratios to ensure comparability across time.\n\nInsights gained from this study could inform studios on what variables drive financial success and help in decision-making for future film projects.\n\n\nCalculating median profit ratio\n\n# Aggregating data by distributor and genre to calculate median profit ratio\nmovie_profit_summary &lt;- movie_profit %&gt;%\n  group_by(distributor, genre) %&gt;%\n  summarize(median_profit_ratio = median(profit_ratio, na.rm = TRUE) , count = n())\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'distributor'.

After revisiting some resources, I realized that gf_col (or geom_col) was the appropriate function to use, as it requires both X and Y variables to plot columns accurately. This was the key issue since gf_bar wasn’t designed for this type of plotting. In my third attempt, I read further to understand how to change the label names on the X-axis. However, I encountered challenges with formatting the numbers correctly.\n\n\nAttempt 4\n\nmovie_profit_summary %&gt;%\n  gf_col(median_profit_ratio ~ genre | distributor, \n         scales = \"free_x\", \n         fill = ~\"darkgrey\", \n         ncol = 3) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Profits made by Film Distributors\",\n    subtitle = \"Ratio of Profits to Budgets\",\n    x = \"median_profit_ratio\",\n    y = \"genre\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(theme_minimal()) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Attempt\n\nmovie_profit_summary %&gt;%\n  gf_col(genre ~ median_profit_ratio | distributor, \n         scales = \"free_x\", \n         fill = \"black\", \n         ncol = 3) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Profits made by Film Distributors\",\n    subtitle = \"Ratio of Profits to Budgets\",\n    x = \"median_profit_ratio\",\n    y = \"genre\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(scale = 1e-14, accuracy = 1, suffix = \"X\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI finally figured it out! I realized that the issue was with the scale for the labeling on the X-axis. The scale needed to be adjusted from 1 to 1e-14 in order to display the numbers correctly. This adjustment made a big difference in cleaning up the axis labels and presenting the data in a more readable format.\n\n\nQuestions\nThe graph titled “Profits made by Film Distributors” seeks to answer the following questions:\n1.How does the profit-to-budget ratio vary across different film genres (Horror, Drama, Comedy, Adventure, Action) for major film distributors?\n( The graph compares the profitability of different genres for distributors like 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, Universal, Warner Bros., and others. This helps to identify which genres are more profitable for specific distributors.)\n\n20th Century Fox has the highest median profit ratio in the Adventure genre with a value of 2.76e+14, followed closely by Action (2.68e+14) and Comedy (2.69e+14).\nParamount Pictures also sees high profits from Adventure films with a median ratio of 2.93e+14, followed by Action (2.78e+14) and Comedy (1.89e+14).\nSony Pictures has the highest median profit ratio for Adventure films (2.47e+14) and Action films (2.22e+14).\nUniversal stands out in the Adventure genre with a median profit ratio of 3.47e+14, showing Adventure films are quite profitable for them.\nWarner Bros. performs best in Horror with a median profit ratio of 3.18e+14, followed by Comedy (1.76e+14).\n\nAcross the board, Adventure and Action films tend to show higher median profit ratios for most major distributors. Horror also stands out for Warner Bros.\n2.Which film distributor yields the highest median profit-to-budget ratio for each genre?\n( By displaying the profit ratios for each genre across multiple distributors, the graph helps to determine which distributor is most successful in turning a profit for specific types of films.)\n\nFor Action, Paramount Pictures leads with a median profit ratio of 2.78e+14.\nIn the Adventure genre, Universal has the highest profit ratio with 3.47e+14.\nWarner Bros. has the highest profit ratio in the Horror genre, at 3.18e+14.\nFor Comedy, Universal stands out with 2.58e+14.\nIn Drama, Paramount Pictures takes the lead with 2.06e+14.\n\nThus, Universal dominates Adventure and Comedy, Paramount Pictures excels in Action and Drama, and Warner Bros. shines in Horror.\n3.How do smaller or unspecified distributors compare to larger, well-known distributors in terms of profitability?\n( The “Other” and “NA” categories allow for a comparison between larger studios and smaller or unclassified distributors, providing insight into whether smaller entities can achieve comparable profitability.)\n\nSmaller distributors grouped under “Other” tend to have median profit ratios that are competitive with the larger studios. For instance, the median profit ratio for Action films under “Other” is 1.76e+14, which is relatively close to that of major distributors.\nThe Horror genre under “Other” also does well with a profit ratio of 2.46e+14, almost on par with Warner Bros.’ high profitability in the same genre (3.18e+14).\n\nThis shows that smaller or unclassified distributors, while not always outperforming the majors, can still achieve significant profitability, particularly in certain genres like Horror or Action.\n\n\nAdditional Questions\n1.Identify the type of plot: The graph is a facet bar plot showing the ratio of profits to budgets for different film genres across various distributors.\n2.What are the variables used to plot this graph?\n\nThe x-axis represents the median profit ratio (Ratio of profits to budgets).\nThe y-axis represents the genres of films (Horror, Drama, Comedy, Adventure, Action).\nThe different facets represent the various distributors (e.g., 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, etc.).\n\n3.If you were to invest in movie production ventures, which are the two best genres that you might decide to invest in?\nAdventure and Action films appear to be the best genres to invest in, as they show the highest median profit ratios across multiple distributors.\n4.Which R command might have been used to obtain the separate plots for each distributor? The gf_facet_wrap command (from the ggformula package) might have been used to create separate plots for each distributor. However, I used the gf_col command.\n5.If the original dataset had BUDGETS and PROFITS in separate columns, what preprocessing might have been done to achieve this plot?\nThe data could be grouped by distributor and genre to calculate the median profit ratio:\nmovie_profit_summary &lt;- movie_profit %&gt;%   group_by(distributor, genre) %&gt;%   summarize(median_profit_ratio = median(profit_ratio, na.rm = TRUE))\nThis would aggregate the data and prepare it for plotting as shown in the graph.\n\n\nInference and Story from the Graph and Data\nThe graph titled “Profits made by Film Distributors” presents a fascinating breakdown of how the median profit ratios for different film genres compare across major film distributors. By plotting this data, we gain valuable insights into the profitability trends of each distributor and their success in various genres.\n\nKey Observations\nFrom the data and the graph, I observed that:\n\nAdventure and Action Dominate: Across most distributors, the Adventure and Action genres consistently exhibit the highest median profit ratios. For instance, in the case of Universal and Warner Bros., the Adventure genre outperforms other genres in terms of profitability, with Action following closely behind. These two genres clearly provide the highest return on investment for these distributors.\nComedy’s Strong Performance: Comedy also shows strong performance across distributors like Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros., highlighting that it’s another genre that often yields significant profits relative to its budget.\nHorror’s Variable Performance: While Horror films generally show high profit margins (especially with Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox), the number of films (represented by the count data) in this genre tends to be lower compared to other genres. This could suggest that while fewer horror films are produced, they tend to be highly profitable.\n\n\n\nWhere Would You Invest?\nIf I were to invest in movie production ventures based on this data, the two best genres to invest in would likely be Adventure and Action. These genres consistently demonstrate the highest profit-to-budget ratios across multiple distributors, making them safe bets for maximizing returns on investment. Adventure films, in particular, seem to have a broad appeal and high profitability, as seen with Universal and Warner Bros., where the Adventure genre outperforms other categories significantly.\nIf I were to invest in movie production ventures based on this data, the two best genres to invest in would likely be Adventure and Action. These genres consistently demonstrate the highest profit-to-budget ratios across multiple distributors, making them safe bets for maximizing returns on investment. Adventure films, in particular, seem to have a broad appeal and high profitability, as seen with Universal and Warner Bros., where the Adventure genre outperforms other categories significantly.\n\n\nThe Role of Distributors\nEach distributor seems to have strengths in different genres. For example:\n\nParamount Pictures shows strong performance across all genres, with no one genre clearly dominating, indicating a well-balanced strategy across its film portfolio.\n20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures both show relatively high profit margins across Action and Adventure, making these genres crucial for their financial success.\nThe “Other” category suggests that smaller or independent distributors can still achieve solid profitability, particularly in genres like Action and Comedy.\n\n\n\nThe Power of Data Visualization\nThis graph not only tells a story about the profitability of genres but also underscores the importance of visualizing data to make informed business decisions. If you are a studio executive or a potential investor, this kind of analysis helps you pinpoint the genres that offer the best return on investment, the distributors that succeed in specific markets, and areas where opportunities might exist."

The dataset contains 25 rows and no missing data. For each variable, the mean, standard deviation (sd), and percentiles (p0, p25, p50, p75, p100) are shown. For example, the hurdles event has a mean of 13.84 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.74, and the scores range from 12.69 to 16.42 seconds. Similarly, the high jump has a mean of 1.78 meters with a low standard deviation of 0.08. The score column has a broad range from 4566 to 7291 points, with a mean score of 6090. These statistics offer an overview of how the athletes’ performances are distributed across the different events.\n\n\n\nQuantitative Data:\n\nhurdles (dbl): The time (in seconds) taken to complete the 100m hurdles event.\nhighjump (dbl): The height (in meters) cleared in the high jump event.\nshot (dbl): The distance (in meters) achieved in the shot put event.\nrun200m (dbl): The time (in seconds) taken to complete the 200m sprint.\nlongjump (dbl): The distance (in meters) achieved in the long jump event.\njavelin (dbl): The distance (in meters) achieved in the javelin throw event.\nrun800m (dbl): The time (in seconds) taken to complete the 800m run.\nscore (int): The total score accumulated from all the events for each athlete.\n\nQualitative Data:\n\nname (chr): The name of the athlete participating in the heptathlon competition.\n\n\n\n\nScore\nThe score is the key outcome of interest in the heptathlon dataset as it represents the cumulative performance of athletes across all events. The goal of the analysis is to understand how each individual event contributes to the overall score. This makes the score the most logical target variable for evaluating the athletes’ success across the seven heptathlon events.\n\n\n\n\nHurdles\n\nThe time taken to complete the 100m hurdles event is a critical factor in determining an athlete’s score. Faster times typically translate into higher scores, making hurdles an important predictor of the overall performance.\n\nHigh Jump\n\nThe height an athlete clears in the high jump event significantly contributes to their score. Higher jumps generally result in more points, making it a valuable predictor for the overall score.\n\nShot Put\n\nThe distance achieved in the shot put event is another factor that influences the total score. Longer throws result in higher points, making this event a crucial predictor of an athlete’s overall performance.\n\n200m Sprint\n\nThe time taken to complete the 200m sprint is an essential measure of an athlete’s speed and stamina. Faster times contribute to higher scores, making the 200m sprint an important predictor variable.\n\nLong Jump\n\nThe distance jumped in the long jump event provides another key input into the total score. Longer jumps generally lead to higher scores, making it an influential predictor.\n\nJavelin Throw\n\nThe distance achieved in the javelin throw event plays a role in determining the athlete’s score. Longer throws result in more points, making this an important predictor for the final score.\n\n800m Run\n\nThe time taken to complete the 800m run is a measure of endurance and speed. Faster times contribute to higher scores, making the 800m run a significant predictor of the overall score.\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of the research experiment could be to measure and evaluate the athletic performance of multiple athletes competing in the heptathlon, a multi-event track and field competition. The goal might have been to assess how individual event performances contribute to the overall score, providing insights into which events could be most predictive of an athlete’s cumulative success.\n\n\nThe experiment could have been designed to test the hypothesis that certain events (e.g., long jump, 200m sprint) would have a stronger correlation with the overall score than others (e.g., shot put or javelin throw).\n\n\n\n\nSubjects: 25 female athletes who participated in an international heptathlon competition, possibly at a world-class event such as the Olympics or World Championships.\nSelection Criteria: Athletes could have been selected based on their qualification to compete in the heptathlon, likely elite athletes with prior experience and high skill levels across the seven events.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Collection Procedure:\n\nThe athletes participated in seven heptathlon events, which took place over two days:\n\n100m hurdles\nHigh jump\nShot put\n200m sprint\nLong jump\nJavelin throw\n800m run\n\nEach event was measured precisely using standard procedures. For example:\n\nTimes for hurdles, 200m sprint, and 800m run were measured using electronic timing systems.\nDistances for shot put, long jump, and javelin throw were measured using precise distance-measuring equipment.\nHeights for the high jump were measured using high-precision tools to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nData Recording:\n\nThe performance of each athlete in each event was recorded. This included:\n\nTime (in seconds) for the sprint events (100m hurdles, 200m sprint, 800m run).\nDistance (in meters) for throwing and jumping events (shot put, long jump, javelin throw).\nHeight (in meters) for the high jump.\nThe results for each event were converted into points using IAAF Heptathlon Scoring Tables (standard scoring guidelines used in heptathlon). The points for each event were summed to obtain the total score for each athlete.\n\n\n\nControlled Variables:\n\nEnvironmental factors such as weather conditions (e.g., wind speed, temperature) that could influence performance might have been controlled or recorded to ensure fairness.\nEquipment used for measurements (e.g., electronic timers, measuring tapes) could have been standardized across all athletes to avoid bias in data collection.\nThe same scoring system (IAAF scoring tables) was applied consistently to convert performance results into points.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nThe researchers analyzed how performance in each of the seven events contributed to the athletes’ overall score.\nCorrelation analysis was likely conducted to assess which events had the most significant impact on the overall score.\nStatistical techniques such as linear regression may have been used to predict the overall score based on the athletes’ individual performances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhighjump_cor &lt;-

Conversely, events like shot put show a weaker correlation, indicating less influence on the overall performance.\n\n\n\n\n(It may seek to analyze whether top-performing athletes excel consistently across all events or if they perform particularly well in specific events, leading to higher overall scores.)\n\nThe data shows that top-performing athletes tend to excel in events like the 200m sprint and hurdles, which are highly correlated with the overall score. However, there is more variability in events such as javelin and shot put, where even lower-performing athletes may achieve comparable results to their higher-ranked counterparts, indicating that these events are less crucial for determining total score.\n\n\n\n\n(The graph could identify events where there is a strong or weak relationship between performance and overall score, helping to pinpoint the most impactful events for overall success in the heptathlon.)\n\nThere is a significant disparity in the correlation of events with the overall score. For instance, the 200m sprint and long jump have a strong positive correlation with the overall score, whereas the javelin throw and shot put have weaker correlations, suggesting they are less critical for overall success in the heptathlon.\n\n\n\n\n(It may seek to explore whether certain events, such as the hurdles or high jump, have a greater impact on the overall score for top-performing athletes compared to those with lower scores.)\n\nYes, events such as hurdles and the 800m run, which are typically associated with speed and endurance, show a stronger correlation with the overall score for top-scoring athletes. These athletes tend to perform consistently well in these events, contributing to their higher scores, while lower-scoring athletes may show more inconsistency across these events.\n\n\n\n\n(The graph could aim to determine whether specific events are more critical in determining the overall outcome, revealing whether strong performance in key events can significantly boost an athlete’s total score.)\n\nYes, events like the 200m sprint and long jump show a disproportionate influence on the overall score, with athletes who perform well in these events often achieving much higher total scores. In contrast, events such as shot put and javelin throw seem to have a smaller influence on the total outcome, suggesting that strong performance in a few key events may be more beneficial for overall success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart is a scatter plot with error bars, specifically designed to visualize the correlation between scores in hurdles and other heptathlon events. The point sizes correspond to the significance of the correlation.\n\n\n\n\nx-axis (Event): Represents the different events in the heptathlon (e.g., high jump, shot put, javelin, etc.).\ny-axis (Correlation with hurdles score): Displays the correlation values between performance in each event and the score in hurdles.\nFill/Shape size (Significance): The size of the points indicates the significance of the correlation (calculated as -log10(p.value)).\nError bars (CI_low, CI_high): Represent the confidence intervals for the correlation values, showing the range within which the actual correlation likely falls.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the graph, the 200m sprint and 800m run are the most highly correlated events with the hurdles scores, as indicated by the positive correlation values and larger significance levels. These events seem to have the strongest association with an athlete’s performance in hurdles.\n\n\n\nBased on the graph, the high jump event does not show a strong correlation with hurdles performance, as its correlation value is negative and the error bars are relatively large, indicating uncertainty in the strength of the relationship. If an athlete excels in both high jump and hurdles, it would suggest they have a unique skill set, combining strong technical ability in high jump (which is less correlated with hurdles) with speed and agility in hurdles (a more significant event). This combination would make them a well-rounded and versatile athlete, excelling in both power-based and speed-based events despite the weaker connection between the two disciplines.\n\n\n\n\nThe graph titled “Heptathlon Scores and Correlations” offers an insightful exploration into the relationship between the seven heptathlon events and their correlations with hurdles performance. By examining the correlation patterns across these events, we uncover key relationships that shape the athletic performance of heptathletes. This visualization provides clarity on which events significantly influence hurdles performance and sheds light on the multidimensional skills required for success in the heptathlon.\n\n\nFrom analyzing the graph and the heptathlon dataset, the following patterns emerged:\n\nStrong Correlation with Speed-Based Events: Events like the 200m sprint and 800m run show the highest positive correlation with hurdles performance. This suggests that athletes who excel in hurdles tend to also perform exceptionally well in speed and endurance events. These events share common elements of speed, agility, and sustained effort, which likely explains their high correlation.\nMixed Correlation with Field Events: The long jump shows a positive correlation with hurdles scores, suggesting that explosive power and coordination are valuable across both events. However, shot put and javelin exhibit weaker correlations with hurdles, which is expected as these events require strength and technique rather than speed, showing that different skills are necessary across the heptathlon.\nWeaker Correlation with High Jump: Surprisingly, high jump has a weaker correlation with hurdles performance. Despite requiring leg strength and explosive power, these skills do not seem to translate as directly to hurdles success, likely due to the technical nature of high jump.\n\n\n\n\nIf we were to draw conclusions from the data, it’s evident that speed-based events are the most closely related to hurdles performance. Athletes who perform well in hurdles are likely to excel in the 200m sprint and 800m run, emphasizing the importance of speed and endurance in the overall heptathlon score. This highlights the key role that sprinting ability plays in shaping an athlete’s overall success in this multi-discipline sport.\nOn the other hand, the field events, while important, contribute less directly to hurdles performance. The mixed correlation suggests that while events like the long jump can complement speed and agility, events such as shot put and javelin rely on entirely different skill sets that do not significantly overlap with hurdles.\n\n\n\nEach heptathlon event provides different insights into the correlation with hurdles performance:\n\nSpeed-Based Events (200m, 800m): These events, which are dominated by speed, stamina, and technique, show strong positive correlations with hurdles. It’s clear that speed is a common denominator for athletes who succeed in hurdles, and mastering these events is crucial for improving overall performance in the heptathlon.\nPower-Based Events (Shot Put, Javelin): These events require strength and technique, showing weaker correlations with hurdles. This highlights that strength-based events do not heavily influence an athlete’s hurdles performance, underscoring the need for a diverse skill set in the heptathlon.\nMixed-Skill Events (Long Jump, High Jump): While long jump shows some positive correlation due to the need for explosive power, high jump shows a weaker relationship, indicating that technical skill in one event doesn’t always translate directly to others.\n\n\n\n\nIf an athlete were a record holder in both high jump and hurdles, they would stand out as an exceptionally versatile competitor. While the correlation between hurdles and high jump is not particularly strong according to the data, the athlete would demonstrate a rare ability to excel in both a speed-based event and a technical jumping event. This speaks to their diversity of skills—combining speed, agility, explosive power, and technical precision—making them a well-rounded and formidable athlete in the heptathlon.\n\n\n\nThis graph effectively highlights how different events within the heptathlon influence hurdles performance, providing valuable insights for athletes, coaches, and sports scientists. By visually representing these correlations, it becomes clear which events an athlete should prioritize to maximize their overall performance. The data underscores the importance of speed-based events and reveals that while field events play a role, they may not be as critical in determining hurdles success.\nThis visualization offers a clear path for athletes to tailor their training strategies by focusing on events that have the most significant impact on hurdles performance, ultimately improving their standing in the heptathlon."

The dataset contains 25 rows and no missing data. For each variable, the mean, standard deviation (sd), and percentiles (p0, p25, p50, p75, p100) are shown. For example, the hurdles event has a mean of 13.84 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.74, and the scores range from 12.69 to 16.42 seconds. Similarly, the high jump has a mean of 1.78 meters with a low standard deviation of 0.08. The score column has a broad range from 4566 to 7291 points, with a mean score of 6090. These statistics offer an overview of how the athletes’ performances are distributed across the different events.\n\n\n\nQuantitative Data:\n\nhurdles (dbl): The time (in seconds) taken to complete the 100m hurdles event.\nhighjump (dbl): The height (in meters) cleared in the high jump event.\nshot (dbl): The distance (in meters) achieved in the shot put event.\nrun200m (dbl): The time (in seconds) taken to complete the 200m sprint.\nlongjump (dbl): The distance (in meters) achieved in the long jump event.\njavelin (dbl): The distance (in meters) achieved in the javelin throw event.\nrun800m (dbl): The time (in seconds) taken to complete the 800m run.\nscore (int): The total score accumulated from all the events for each athlete.\n\nQualitative Data:\n\nname (chr): The name of the athlete participating in the heptathlon competition.\n\n\n\n\nScore\nThe score is the key outcome of interest in the heptathlon dataset as it represents the cumulative performance of athletes across all events. The goal of the analysis is to understand how each individual event contributes to the overall score. This makes the score the most logical target variable for evaluating the athletes’ success across the seven heptathlon events.\n\n\n\n\nHurdles\n\nThe time taken to complete the 100m hurdles event is a critical factor in determining an athlete’s score. Faster times typically translate into higher scores, making hurdles an important predictor of the overall performance.\n\nHigh Jump\n\nThe height an athlete clears in the high jump event significantly contributes to their score. Higher jumps generally result in more points, making it a valuable predictor for the overall score.\n\nShot Put\n\nThe distance achieved in the shot put event is another factor that influences the total score. Longer throws result in higher points, making this event a crucial predictor of an athlete’s overall performance.\n\n200m Sprint\n\nThe time taken to complete the 200m sprint is an essential measure of an athlete’s speed and stamina. Faster times contribute to higher scores, making the 200m sprint an important predictor variable.\n\nLong Jump\n\nThe distance jumped in the long jump event provides another key input into the total score. Longer jumps generally lead to higher scores, making it an influential predictor.\n\nJavelin Throw\n\nThe distance achieved in the javelin throw event plays a role in determining the athlete’s score. Longer throws result in more points, making this an important predictor for the final score.\n\n800m Run\n\nThe time taken to complete the 800m run is a measure of endurance and speed. Faster times contribute to higher scores, making the 800m run a significant predictor of the overall score.\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of the research experiment could be to measure and evaluate the athletic performance of multiple athletes competing in the heptathlon, a multi-event track and field competition. The goal might have been to assess how individual event performances contribute to the overall score, providing insights into which events could be most predictive of an athlete’s cumulative success.\n\n\nThe experiment could have been designed to test the hypothesis that certain events (e.g., long jump, 200m sprint) would have a stronger correlation with the overall score than others (e.g., shot put or javelin throw).\n\n\n\n\nSubjects: 25 female athletes who participated in an international heptathlon competition, possibly at a world-class event such as the Olympics or World Championships.\nSelection Criteria: Athletes could have been selected based on their qualification to compete in the heptathlon, likely elite athletes with prior experience and high skill levels across the seven events.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Collection Procedure:\n\nThe athletes participated in seven heptathlon events, which took place over two days:\n\n100m hurdles\nHigh jump\nShot put\n200m sprint\nLong jump\nJavelin throw\n800m run\n\nEach event was measured precisely using standard procedures. For example:\n\nTimes for hurdles, 200m sprint, and 800m run were measured using electronic timing systems.\nDistances for shot put, long jump, and javelin throw were measured using precise distance-measuring equipment.\nHeights for the high jump were measured using high-precision tools to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nData Recording:\n\nThe performance of each athlete in each event was recorded. This included:\n\nTime (in seconds) for the sprint events (100m hurdles, 200m sprint, 800m run).\nDistance (in meters) for throwing and jumping events (shot put, long jump, javelin throw).\nHeight (in meters) for the high jump.\nThe results for each event were converted into points using IAAF Heptathlon Scoring Tables (standard scoring guidelines used in heptathlon). The points for each event were summed to obtain the total score for each athlete.\n\n\n\nControlled Variables:\n\nEnvironmental factors such as weather conditions (e.g., wind speed, temperature) that could influence performance might have been controlled or recorded to ensure fairness.\nEquipment used for measurements (e.g., electronic timers, measuring tapes) could have been standardized across all athletes to avoid bias in data collection.\nThe same scoring system (IAAF scoring tables) was applied consistently to convert performance results into points.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nThe researchers analyzed how performance in each of the seven events contributed to the athletes’ overall score.\nCorrelation analysis was likely conducted to assess which events had the most significant impact on the overall score.\nStatistical techniques such as linear regression may have been used to predict the overall score based on the athletes’ individual performances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhighjump_cor &lt;-

Conversely, events like shot put show a weaker correlation, indicating less influence on the overall performance.\n\n\n\n\n(It may seek to analyze whether top-performing athletes excel consistently across all events or if they perform particularly well in specific events, leading to higher overall scores.)\n\nThe data shows that top-performing athletes tend to excel in events like the 200m sprint and hurdles, which are highly correlated with the overall score. However, there is more variability in events such as javelin and shot put, where even lower-performing athletes may achieve comparable results to their higher-ranked counterparts, indicating that these events are less crucial for determining total score.\n\n\n\n\n(The graph could identify events where there is a strong or weak relationship between performance and overall score, helping to pinpoint the most impactful events for overall success in the heptathlon.)\n\nThere is a significant disparity in the correlation of events with the overall score. For instance, the 200m sprint and long jump have a strong positive correlation with the overall score, whereas the javelin throw and shot put have weaker correlations, suggesting they are less critical for overall success in the heptathlon.\n\n\n\n\n(It may seek to explore whether certain events, such as the hurdles or high jump, have a greater impact on the overall score for top-performing athletes compared to those with lower scores.)\n\nYes, events such as hurdles and the 800m run, which are typically associated with speed and endurance, show a stronger correlation with the overall score for top-scoring athletes. These athletes tend to perform consistently well in these events, contributing to their higher scores, while lower-scoring athletes may show more inconsistency across these events.\n\n\n\n\n(The graph could aim to determine whether specific events are more critical in determining the overall outcome, revealing whether strong performance in key events can significantly boost an athlete’s total score.)\n\nYes, events like the 200m sprint and long jump show a disproportionate influence on the overall score, with athletes who perform well in these events often achieving much higher total scores. In contrast, events such as shot put and javelin throw seem to have a smaller influence on the total outcome, suggesting that strong performance in a few key events may be more beneficial for overall success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart is a scatter plot with error bars, specifically designed to visualize the correlation between scores in hurdles and other heptathlon events. The point sizes correspond to the significance of the correlation.\n\n\n\n\nx-axis (Event): Represents the different events in the heptathlon (e.g., high jump, shot put, javelin, etc.).\ny-axis (Correlation with hurdles score): Displays the correlation values between performance in each event and the score in hurdles.\nFill/Shape size (Significance): The size of the points indicates the significance of the correlation (calculated as -log10(p.value)).\nError bars (CI_low, CI_high): Represent the confidence intervals for the correlation values, showing the range within which the actual correlation likely falls.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the graph, the 200m sprint and 800m run are the most highly correlated events with the hurdles scores, as indicated by the positive correlation values and larger significance levels. These events seem to have the strongest association with an athlete’s performance in hurdles.\n\n\n\nBased on the graph, the high jump event does not show a strong correlation with hurdles performance, as its correlation value is negative and the error bars are relatively large, indicating uncertainty in the strength of the relationship. If an athlete excels in both high jump and hurdles, it would suggest they have a unique skill set, combining strong technical ability in high jump (which is less correlated with hurdles) with speed and agility in hurdles (a more significant event). This combination would make them a well-rounded and versatile athlete, excelling in both power-based and speed-based events despite the weaker connection between the two disciplines.\n\n\n\n\nThe graph titled “Heptathlon Scores and Correlations” offers an insightful exploration into the relationship between the seven heptathlon events and their correlations with hurdles performance. By examining the correlation patterns across these events, we uncover key relationships that shape the athletic performance of heptathletes. This visualization provides clarity on which events significantly influence hurdles performance and sheds light on the multidimensional skills required for success in the heptathlon.\n\n\nFrom analyzing the graph and the heptathlon dataset, the following patterns emerged:\n\nStrong Correlation with Speed-Based Events: Events like the 200m sprint and 800m run show the highest positive correlation with hurdles performance. This suggests that athletes who excel in hurdles tend to also perform exceptionally well in speed and endurance events. These events share common elements of speed, agility, and sustained effort, which likely explains their high correlation.\nMixed Correlation with Field Events: The long jump shows a positive correlation with hurdles scores, suggesting that explosive power and coordination are valuable across both events. However, shot put and javelin exhibit weaker correlations with hurdles, which is expected as these events require strength and technique rather than speed, showing that different skills are necessary across the heptathlon.\nWeaker Correlation with High Jump: Surprisingly, high jump has a weaker correlation with hurdles performance. Despite requiring leg strength and explosive power, these skills do not seem to translate as directly to hurdles success, likely due to the technical nature of high jump.\n\n\n\n\nIf we were to draw conclusions from the data, it’s evident that speed-based events are the most closely related to hurdles performance. Athletes who perform well in hurdles are likely to excel in the 200m sprint and 800m run, emphasizing the importance of speed and endurance in the overall heptathlon score. This highlights the key role that sprinting ability plays in shaping an athlete’s overall success in this multi-discipline sport.\nOn the other hand, the field events, while important, contribute less directly to hurdles performance. The mixed correlation suggests that while events like the long jump can complement speed and agility, events such as shot put and javelin rely on entirely different skill sets that do not significantly overlap with hurdles.\n\n\n\nEach heptathlon event provides different insights into the correlation with hurdles performance:\n\nSpeed-Based Events (200m, 800m): These events, which are dominated by speed, stamina, and technique, show strong positive correlations with hurdles. It’s clear that speed is a common denominator for athletes who succeed in hurdles, and mastering these events is crucial for improving overall performance in the heptathlon.\nPower-Based Events (Shot Put, Javelin): These events require strength and technique, showing weaker correlations with hurdles. This highlights that strength-based events do not heavily influence an athlete’s hurdles performance, underscoring the need for a diverse skill set in the heptathlon.\nMixed-Skill Events (Long Jump, High Jump): While long jump shows some positive correlation due to the need for explosive power, high jump shows a weaker relationship, indicating that technical skill in one event doesn’t always translate directly to others.\n\n\n\n\nIf an athlete were a record holder in both high jump and hurdles, they would stand out as an exceptionally versatile competitor. While the correlation between hurdles and high jump is not particularly strong according to the data, the athlete would demonstrate a rare ability to excel in both a speed-based event and a technical jumping event. This speaks to their diversity of skills—combining speed, agility, explosive power, and technical precision—making them a well-rounded and formidable athlete in the heptathlon.\n\n\n\nThis graph effectively highlights how different events within the heptathlon influence hurdles performance, providing valuable insights for athletes, coaches, and sports scientists. By visually representing these correlations, it becomes clear which events an athlete should prioritize to maximize their overall performance. The data underscores the importance of speed-based events and reveals that while field events play a role, they may not be as critical in determining hurdles success.\nThis visualization offers a clear path for athletes to tailor their training strategies by focusing on events that have the most significant impact on hurdles performance, ultimately improving their standing in the heptathlon."
