Welcome to my blog! My name is Khushi, and I'm passionate about data visualization, interaction design, photography and game design, and music.

I love capturing moments through the lens, exploring creative ways to communicate through visuals. Music deeply influences my creativity.

## What I Do

-Build games with educational goals, integrating fun with learning

-Design user interfaces to enhance user experience and engagement

-Explore and tell stories through data visualization, making information more accessible and insightful

-Enjoy photography, especially animal portraits and outdoor shoots

-Connect music to visual arts, using it as inspiration for both photography and design
