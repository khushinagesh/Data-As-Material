This is the most logical target variable because it represents the business performance of the movies in financial terms. The goal of analysis could be to understand what factors influence the profitability of movies.\n\n### Predictor Variables\n\n-   **Production Budget**\n\n    The amount of money spent to produce a movie likely affects its profit ratio. Larger budgets may lead to higher production values, star power, or marketing, but may also increase the risk of lower profitability if the movie doesn’t perform well.\n\n-   **Domestic Gross**\n\n    The domestic box office earnings provide a direct measure of the movie's success within its home country, which likely impacts the overall profitability.\n\n-   **Worldwide Gross**\n\n    Like domestic gross, this variable represents the movie's global earnings, which play a crucial role in determining profitability, especially for internationally successful films.\n\n-   **Distributor**\n\n    Different distributors may have different levels of market reach, marketing budgets, and strategic capabilities, which could influence a movie's success and profit ratio.\n\n-   **MPAA Rating**\n\n    The MPAA rating (e.g., PG, PG-13, R) affects the audience size and demographics. Certain ratings may limit a movie's audience, which could affect its overall profitability.\n\n-   **Genre**\n\n    Different genres attract different audience demographics, which could influence box office performance and profitability. Some genres might consistently perform better than others.\n\n-   **Release Date**\n\n    The timing of a movie's release (e.g., summer blockbuster season, holiday period) can significantly influence its box office performance, which may impact profitability.\n\n-   **Decade**\n\n    The decade provides a historical context. Movies released in different decades may face different market conditions (e.g., competition, audience preferences, economic conditions), influencing profitability.\n\n### Research Experiment to Investigate Movie Profitability\n\nThe objective of this research experiment could have been to explore the factors that potentially influence the profitability of movies. The study might have aimed to analyze how various variables related to movie production, such as budget, genre, distributor, and MPAA rating, as well as market performance indicators like domestic and worldwide gross earnings, could affect a movie's **profit ratio**.\n\nSeveral hypotheses could have been proposed:\n\n-   Movies with higher production budgets might correlate with lower profit ratios, possibly due to the increased financial risk associated with larger budgets.\n\n-   Certain genres, such as action or adventure, could exhibit higher profit ratios compared to others like drama or comedy.\n\n-   Films distributed by larger studios, such as Warner Bros. or Paramount Pictures, might show better financial performance than those handled by smaller distributors.\n\n-   MPAA ratings could also play a role in profitability, with R-rated films potentially drawing smaller audiences compared to PG or PG-13 rated films.\n\nThe dataset used for this study consists of 3,310 movies from 1936 to 2017. The sample includes data on production budgets, domestic and worldwide gross, distributors, MPAA ratings, genres, profit ratios, and the decade in which the movie was released.\n\nThe data could have been obtained from box office databases (e.g., Box Office Mojo, IMDb), industry reports, and public financial records of movie studios. Additional information such as MPAA ratings and genres could be sourced from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and film databases.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n-   **Missing Data:** Some movies may have incomplete data (e.g., missing MPAA ratings or gross earnings), which could affect the robustness of conclusions.\n\n-   **External Factors:** The dataset may not account for external factors like economic downturns, marketing spend, or competition from other media during the release window, all of which could impact profitability.\n\n-   **Historical Bias:** Older movies may have different box office reporting practices, and inflation was likely accounted for in calculating the profit ratios to ensure comparability across time.\n\nInsights gained from this study could inform studios on what variables drive financial success and help in decision-making for future film projects.\n\n### Calculating median profit ratio\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Aggregating data by distributor and genre to calculate median profit ratio\nmovie_profit_summary <- movie_profit %>%\n  group_by(distributor, genre) %>%\n  summarize(median_profit_ratio = median(profit_ratio, na.rm = TRUE) , count = n())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'distributor'.

I realized that the issue was with the scale for the labeling on the X-axis. The scale needed to be adjusted from 1 to 1e-14 in order to display the numbers correctly. This adjustment made a big difference in cleaning up the axis labels and presenting the data in a more readable format.\n\n### Questions\n\nThe graph titled \"Profits made by Film Distributors\" seeks to answer the following questions:\n\n**1.How does the profit-to-budget ratio vary across different film genres (Horror, Drama, Comedy, Adventure, Action) for major film distributors?**\n\n( The graph compares the profitability of different genres for distributors like 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, Universal, Warner Bros., and others. This helps to identify which genres are more profitable for specific distributors.)\n\n-   **20th Century Fox** has the highest median profit ratio in the **Adventure** genre with a value of 2.76e+14, followed closely by **Action** (2.68e+14) and **Comedy** (2.69e+14).\n-   **Paramount Pictures** also sees high profits from **Adventure** films with a median ratio of 2.93e+14, followed by **Action** (2.78e+14) and **Comedy** (1.89e+14).\n-   **Sony Pictures** has the highest median profit ratio for **Adventure** films (2.47e+14) and **Action** films (2.22e+14).\n-   **Universal** stands out in the **Adventure** genre with a median profit ratio of 3.47e+14, showing Adventure films are quite profitable for them.\n-   **Warner Bros.** performs best in **Horror** with a median profit ratio of 3.18e+14, followed by **Comedy** (1.76e+14).\n\nAcross the board, **Adventure** and **Action** films tend to show higher median profit ratios for most major distributors. **Horror** also stands out for Warner Bros.\n\n**2.Which film distributor yields the highest median profit-to-budget ratio for each genre?**\n\n( By displaying the profit ratios for each genre across multiple distributors, the graph helps to determine which distributor is most successful in turning a profit for specific types of films.)\n\n-   For **Action**, **Paramount Pictures** leads with a median profit ratio of 2.78e+14.\n\n-   In the **Adventure** genre, **Universal** has the highest profit ratio with 3.47e+14.\n\n-   **Warner Bros.** has the highest profit ratio in the **Horror** genre, at 3.18e+14.\n\n-   For **Comedy**, **Universal** stands out with 2.58e+14.\n\n-   In **Drama**, **Paramount Pictures** takes the lead with 2.06e+14.\n\nThus, **Universal** dominates Adventure and Comedy, **Paramount Pictures** excels in Action and Drama, and **Warner Bros.** shines in Horror.\n\n**3.How do smaller or unspecified distributors compare to larger, well-known distributors in terms of profitability?**\n\n( The \"Other\" and \"NA\" categories allow for a comparison between larger studios and smaller or unclassified distributors, providing insight into whether smaller entities can achieve comparable profitability.)\n\n-   Smaller distributors grouped under \"Other\" tend to have median profit ratios that are competitive with the larger studios. For instance, the median profit ratio for **Action** films under \"Other\" is 1.76e+14, which is relatively close to that of major distributors.\n\n-   The **Horror** genre under \"Other\" also does well with a profit ratio of 2.46e+14, almost on par with **Warner Bros.'** high profitability in the same genre (3.18e+14).\n\nThis shows that smaller or unclassified distributors, while not always outperforming the majors, can still achieve significant profitability, particularly in certain genres like Horror or Action.\n\n### Additional Questions\n\n**1.Identify the type of plot:**\nThe graph is a **facet bar plot** showing the ratio of profits to budgets for different film genres across various distributors.\n\n**2.What are the variables used to plot this graph?**\n\n-   The **x-axis** represents the **median profit ratio** (Ratio of profits to budgets).\n\n-   The **y-axis** represents the **genres** of films (Horror, Drama, Comedy, Adventure, Action).\n\n-   The different **facets** represent the various **distributors** (e.g., 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, etc.).\n\n**3.If you were to invest in movie production ventures, which are the two best genres that you might decide to invest in?**\n\n**Adventure** and **Action** films appear to be the best genres to invest in, as they show the highest median profit ratios across multiple distributors.\n\n**4.Which R command might have been used to obtain the separate plots for each distributor?**\nThe gf_facet_wrap command (from the **ggformula** package) might have been used to create separate plots for each distributor. However, I used the gf_col command.\n\n**5.If the original dataset had BUDGETS and PROFITS in separate columns, what preprocessing might have been done to achieve this plot?**\n\nThe data could be **grouped by distributor and genre** to calculate the **median profit ratio**:\n\n`movie_profit_summary <- movie_profit %>%   group_by(distributor, genre) %>%   summarize(median_profit_ratio = median(profit_ratio, na.rm = TRUE))`\n\nThis would aggregate the data and prepare it for plotting as shown in the graph.\n\n### Inference and Story from the Graph and Data\n\nThe graph titled \"Profits made by Film Distributors\" presents a fascinating breakdown of how the median profit ratios for different film genres compare across major film distributors. By plotting this data, we gain valuable insights into the profitability trends of each distributor and their success in various genres.\n\n#### **Key Observations**\n\nFrom the data and the graph, I observed that:\n\n-   **Adventure and Action Dominate**: Across most distributors, the Adventure and Action genres consistently exhibit the highest median profit ratios. For instance, in the case of Universal and Warner Bros., the Adventure genre outperforms other genres in terms of profitability, with Action following closely behind. These two genres clearly provide the highest return on investment for these distributors.\n\n-   **Comedy's Strong Performance**: Comedy also shows strong performance across distributors like Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros., highlighting that it's another genre that often yields significant profits relative to its budget.\n\n-   **Horror's Variable Performance**: While Horror films generally show high profit margins (especially with Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox), the number of films (represented by the count data) in this genre tends to be lower compared to other genres. This could suggest that while fewer horror films are produced, they tend to be highly profitable.\n\n####  **Where Would You Invest?**\n\nIf I were to invest in movie production ventures based on this data, the two best genres to invest in would likely be **Adventure** and **Action**. These genres consistently demonstrate the highest profit-to-budget ratios across multiple distributors, making them safe bets for maximizing returns on investment. Adventure films, in particular, seem to have a broad appeal and high profitability, as seen with Universal and Warner Bros., where the Adventure genre outperforms other categories significantly.\n\nIf I were to invest in movie production ventures based on this data, the two best genres to invest in would likely be **Adventure** and **Action**. These genres consistently demonstrate the highest profit-to-budget ratios across multiple distributors, making them safe bets for maximizing returns on investment. Adventure films, in particular, seem to have a broad appeal and high profitability, as seen with Universal and Warner Bros., where the Adventure genre outperforms other categories significantly.\n\n#### **The Role of Distributors**\n\nEach distributor seems to have strengths in different genres. For example:\n\n-   **Paramount Pictures** shows strong performance across all genres, with no one genre clearly dominating, indicating a well-balanced strategy across its film portfolio.\n\n-   **20th Century Fox** and **Sony Pictures** both show relatively high profit margins across Action and Adventure, making these genres crucial for their financial success.\n\n-   The **\"Other\"** category suggests that smaller or independent distributors can still achieve solid profitability, particularly in genres like Action and Comedy.\n\n#### **The Power of Data Visualization**\n\nThis graph not only tells a story about the profitability of genres but also underscores the importance of visualizing data to make informed business decisions. If you are a studio executive or a potential investor, this kind of analysis helps you pinpoint the genres that offer the best return on investment, the distributors that succeed in specific markets, and areas where opportunities might exist.\n",
