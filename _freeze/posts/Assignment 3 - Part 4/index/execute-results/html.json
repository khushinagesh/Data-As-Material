By collecting and analyzing rating data from students, we aim to explore if there are differences in popularity across shows, and whether male and female students rate these shows differently.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n\n-   *Primary Hypothesis:* There is a significant difference in the ratings given to *Doraemon*, *Dragon Tales*, and *Chhota Bheem*.\n\n-   *Additional Hypotheses:*\n\n    -   *Doraemon* tends to receive higher ratings on average compared to *Dragon Tales* and *Chhota Bheem*, indicating a stronger preference for this show.\n\n    -   There is a significant interaction between gender and show preferences, suggesting that male and female students may rate these shows differently.\n\n**Experiment Design:**\n\n**Data Collection:**\n\n-   *Sample:* The dataset consists of ratings from 90 students at MAHE Bengaluru, with 30 participants rating each show, totaling 90 responses. Each participant rated only one assigned show, ensuring 30 ratings per show with an equal distribution of male and female participants.\n\n-   *Data Sources:* Participants were randomly selected by tossing a coin, and the ratings were recorded in an Excel sheet by the experiment conductors. Each participant rated the show they were assigned on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest score.\n\n**Variables Measured:**\n\n-   *Target Variable:* The rating given by each participant to the assigned show.\n\n-   *Predictor Variables:* Show (*Doraemon*, *Dragon Tales*, *Chhota Bheem*) and Gender (Male, Female).\n\n**Sampling:**\n\n-   *Time Period:* The experiment was conducted over a period of 1.5 hours on October 24th, 2024.\n\n-   *Participant Selection Criteria:* 90 participants were randomly assigned to rate one of the three shows, with balanced representation by gender (15 males and 15 females per show).\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n-   *Data Cleaning and Transformation:*The data was checked for accuracy in the Excel sheet to ensure that each participant's rating, show assignment, and gender were properly recorded, with no missing or erroneous entries.\n\n-   *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots will be used to compare rating distributions across the three shows and examine any differences by gender. This will help identify patterns or preferences among the participants.\n\n**Statistical Tests:**\n\n-   *Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality:*The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to check if the rating data follows a normal distribution for each show. If the data significantly deviates from normality (p-value \\< 0.05), it suggests the use of non-parametric tests.\n\n-   *Variance Test (F-Test):*A variance test will be conducted to determine if the variances in ratings are equal between the shows. This test will check the assumption of homogeneity of variances, which is required for the two-sample t-test and ANOVA. If the p-value is small (p-value \\< 0.05), it indicates unequal variances.\n\n-   *One-Way ANOVA:* A one-way ANOVA will be conducted to compare the average ratings across the three shows. This will help determine if there is a statistically significant difference in ratings between the shows.\n\n-   *Two-Way ANOVA:*A two-way ANOVA will be conducted to examine the effects of both show and gender on the average ratings. This will help determine if there are main effects of show or gender, and if there is an interaction effect between the two factors.\n\n-   *Pairwise Comparisons:*If the two-way ANOVA is significant, post-hoc pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni correction will be conducted to identify specific differences in ratings between pairs of shows for each gender.\n\n-   *Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test:*If the normality assumption is not met, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be conducted to compare the ratings between shows and between genders. This will assess whether male and female students rate one show higher or lower compared to the others.\n\n-   *Kruskal-Wallis Test (Non-Parametric Alternative to ANOVA):* If assumptions for ANOVA are violated, this test can assess differences in ratings across the three shows.\n\n-   *Tukey Test:*If ANOVA results are significant, a Tukey Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test will be used to further explore the pairwise differences in the mean ratings between the shows for each gender. This test will provide specific pairwise comparisons to determine which shows differ significantly.\n\n-   *Permutation Test:*A permutation test will be conducted to assess the likelihood of the observed differences in ratings across the three shows occurring by chance, providing a non-parametric alternative to the one-way ANOVA.\n\n-   *Descriptive Statistics:*Descriptive measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation will be calculated for each show and gender group to summarize rating performance. These statistics will help provide a clear overview of the central tendencies and variability within each group.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n-   *Sample Size:* With 30 participants rating each show and equal representation of male and female students, the results may not be generalizable to the entire student population or other demographic groups. A more extensive sample would provide greater reliability and external validity.\n\n-   *Contextual Factors:* The study did not account for other factors that might influence ratings, such as participants' prior exposure to the shows or personal preferences in show genres, which could have an effect on the ratings.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe analysis will reveal whether significant differences in show ratings exist among students at MAHE Bengaluru, and whether these differences are influenced by gender. If the hypotheses hold, it would suggest that one show (e.g., *Doraemon*) tends to be more popular among students, with potential gender-based differences in preferences. These findings will provide insights into the viewing preferences of the target audience within this academic context.\n\n### Dataset - TV Shows\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshows <- read_csv(\"../../data/tvshows.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 90 Columns: 4\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): Participant ID, Gender, Cartoon\ndbl (1): Rating\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshows\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 90 × 4\n   `Participant ID` Gender Cartoon      Rating\n   <chr>            <chr>  <chr>         <dbl>\n 1 P1               Male   Chhota Bheem    8.5\n 2 P2               Male   Chhota Bheem    6  \n 3 P3               Male   Chhota Bheem    8  \n 4 P4               Male   Chhota Bheem    7  \n 5 P5               Male   Chhota Bheem    8  \n 6 P6               Male   Chhota Bheem   10  \n 7 P7               Male   Chhota Bheem    5  \n 8 P8               Male   Chhota Bheem    7.8\n 9 P9               Male   Chhota Bheem    8.5\n10 P10              Male   Chhota Bheem    5  \n# ℹ 80 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset consists of ratings given by 90 participants, each providing a rating for one of three cartoons: *Chhota Bheem*, *Doraemon*, and *Dragon Tales*.

The plot reveals that the median rating for Chhota Bheem is slightly higher among males than females, while for Dragon Tales, females appear to give slightly higher ratings than males. Doraemon shows a relatively consistent distribution across genders, though with some outliers among male ratings.\n\n### Errorbar Plot - Mean Ratings of TV Shows with 95% Confidence Interval Error Bars\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshows_summary <- shows_modified %>%\n  group_by(Cartoon) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mean_rating = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE),\n    sd_rating = sd(Rating, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n(),\n    se = sd_rating / sqrt(n),       \n    ci_95 = 1.96 * se                  \n  )\ngf_point(\n  mean_rating ~ Cartoon,               \n  data = shows_summary,                \n  size = 4,                           \n  color = ~ Cartoon                    \n) %>%\n  gf_errorbar(\n    ymin = ~ mean_rating - ci_95,     \n    ymax = ~ mean_rating + ci_95,      \n    width = 0.2                        \n  ) %>%\n  gf_hline(\n    yintercept = 7.062,                    \n    color = \"red\",                    \n    linewidth = 1.5                    \n  ) %>%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Mean Ratings of TV Shows with 95% Confidence Interval Error Bars\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean ratings with 95% CI\",\n    x = \"TV Show\",\n    y = \"Mean Rating\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe bar plot with error bars displays the mean ratings of three TV shows, each represented by a point with accompanying error bars indicating the 95% confidence intervals.

This analysis allows us to understand that any observed rating differences between these shows are likely due to chance, rather than a true difference in audience ratings.\n\n### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test - Chhota Bheem vs Dragon Tales\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwilcox_test_bheem_dragon <- wilcox.test(\n  Rating ~ Cartoon,\n  data = shows_modified %>% filter(Cartoon %in% c(\"Chhota Bheem\", \"Dragon Tales\")),\n  alternative = \"two.sided\",\n  conf.int = TRUE\n) %>%\n  broom::tidy()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in wilcox.test.default(x = DATA[[1L]], y = DATA[[2L]], ...): cannot\ncompute exact p-value with ties\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in wilcox.test.default(x = DATA[[1L]], y = DATA[[2L]], ...): cannot\ncompute exact confidence intervals with ties\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwilcox_test_bheem_dragon\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  estimate statistic p.value conf.low conf.high method               alternative\n     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>                <chr>      \n1    -1.00       337  0.0918    -1.70 0.0000226 Wilcoxon rank sum t… two.sided  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, the p-value is approximately 0.0918, which is above the typical significance threshold of 0.05, indicating that the difference in median ratings between \"Chhota Bheem\" and \"Dragon Tales\" is not statistically significant at the 5% level. The confidence interval for the difference in ratings spans both positive and negative values, further supporting the conclusion of no significant difference in ratings between these two shows in this test.\n\n### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test - Doraemon vs Dragon Tales\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwilcox_test_doraemon_dragon <- wilcox.test(\n  Rating ~ Cartoon,\n  data = shows_modified %>% filter(Cartoon %in% c(\"Doraemon\", \"Dragon Tales\")),\n  alternative = \"two.sided\",\n  conf.int = TRUE\n) %>%\n  broom::tidy()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in wilcox.test.default(x = DATA[[1L]], y = DATA[[2L]], ...): cannot\ncompute exact p-value with ties\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in wilcox.test.default(x = DATA[[1L]], y = DATA[[2L]], ...): cannot\ncompute exact confidence intervals with ties\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwilcox_test_doraemon_dragon\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n   estimate statistic p.value conf.low conf.high method              alternative\n      <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>               <chr>      \n1 0.0000514      462.   0.869    -1.00      1.00 Wilcoxon rank sum … two.sided  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis test resulted in a test statistic of 461.5 with a p-value of approximately 0.869. The confidence interval for the difference in median ratings ranges from -0.999 to 1.000. Given the high p-value, there is no statistically significant difference in median ratings between \"Doraemon\" and \"Dragon Tales\", suggesting that viewers rate these two shows similarly on average.\n\n### Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkruskal_test_result <- kruskal.test(Rating ~ Cartoon, data = shows_modified) %>%  broom::tidy()\nkruskal_test_result\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  statistic p.value parameter method                      \n      <dbl>   <dbl>     <int> <chr>                       \n1      3.83   0.148         2 Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn learning about the Kruskal-Wallis test, I discovered it as a non-parametric alternative to the One-Way ANOVA, particularly useful when the data does not meet the normality assumption required by ANOVA. This test compares the medians of multiple groups to determine if there are significant differences among them. By ranking the data and assessing the distribution of these ranks across groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test provides insight without relying on normally distributed data.\n\nIn applying the test to compare ratings across the three TV shows (*Chhota Bheem*, *Doraemon*, and *Dragon Tales*), I obtained a test statistic of 3.825 with a p-value of approximately 0.148. Since the p-value is greater than the common significance level of 0.05, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the ratings among the shows. This suggests that the median ratings across the three shows are not significantly different based on this sample.\n\n### Tukey Multiple Comparisons\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm_model <- lm(Rating ~ Cartoon, data = shows_modified)\ntukey_results <- TukeyHSD(aov(lm_model))\nprint(tukey_results)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = lm_model)\n\n$Cartoon\n                                diff        lwr      upr     p adj\nDoraemon-Chhota Bheem     0.58000000 -0.6152594 1.775259 0.4819563\nDragon Tales-Chhota Bheem 0.59666667 -0.5985927 1.791926 0.4621079\nDragon Tales-Doraemon     0.01666667 -1.1785927 1.211926 0.9993907\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe Tukey's HSD (Honest Significant Difference) test was performed to identify any significant pairwise differences in the ratings among the three TV shows: *Doraemon*, *Chhota Bheem*, and *Dragon Tales*. The results show the difference in mean ratings between each pair of shows along with confidence intervals and adjusted p-values. The p-values for each pairwise comparison are above 0.05, indicating that none of the differences in ratings between the shows are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Therefore, we conclude that there is no significant difference in the ratings among *Doraemon*, *Chhota Bheem*, and *Dragon Tales* based on this analysis.\n\n### Permutation Test\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobserved_perm <- shows_modified %>%\n  specify(Rating ~ Cartoon) %>%\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") %>%\n  calculate(stat = \"F\")\n\nnull_dist_perm <- shows_modified %>%\n  specify(Rating ~ Cartoon) %>%\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") %>%\n  generate(reps = 5000, type = \"permute\") %>%\n  calculate(stat = \"F\")\n\nnull_dist_perm %>%\n  visualize() +\n  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_perm$stat, direction = \"greater\") +\n  annotation_logticks(outside = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nperm_p_value <- null_dist_perm %>%\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_perm$stat, direction = \"greater\")\nperm_p_value\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  p_value\n    <dbl>\n1   0.405\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this permutation test, the goal was to assess whether the observed differences in ratings among the three TV shows could be attributed to chance. By permuting the ratings data 5,000 times, a null distribution was generated, and the test statistic (F-statistic) for the observed data was compared against this simulated distribution. The visual output shows the null distribution, with the observed test statistic highlighted. The resulting p-value of 0.409 indicates that there is a 40.9% probability that the observed differences in ratings could occur by random chance, suggesting no statistically significant differences in ratings across the shows under the non-parametric assumptions.\n\n### Summary of Results for the TV Shows Research Experiment\n\nThe research experiment aimed to investigate if there were significant differences in ratings among three popular TV shows: *Chhota Bheem*, *Doraemon*, and *Dragon Tales*, and to examine the effect of gender on these ratings. The following statistical analyses were conducted:\n\n#### Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality:\n\nThe Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to check if the ratings for each show followed a normal distribution:\n\n-   *Chhota Bheem*: W = 0.9515, p = 0.1854\n\n-   *Doraemon*: W = 0.9087, p = 0.01385\n\n-   *Dragon Tales*: W = 0.9181, p = 0.02395\n\nWith small p-values for *Doraemon* and *Dragon Tales*, the ratings for these shows deviated from normality, suggesting that non-parametric tests would be suitable for further analysis.\n\n#### Variance Test:\n\nLevene's test and Fligner-Killeen test were used to check if the variances were equal across the three shows:\n\n-   **Levene’s Test**: p = 0.2798\n\n-   **Fligner-Killeen Test**: p = 0.4038\n\nBoth tests indicated no significant difference in variances, so the assumption of equal variances was not violated, allowing for ANOVA to be applied.\n\n#### One-Way ANOVA:\n\nA one-way ANOVA was conducted to assess differences in mean ratings across the three shows:\n\n-   **F(2, 87) = 0.919, p = 0.403**\n\nThe ANOVA results showed no statistically significant difference in average ratings across the shows, indicating that there may not be a substantial difference in viewer ratings among the three programs.\n\n#### Two-Way ANOVA:\n\nA two-way ANOVA was conducted to analyze the combined effects of TV show and gender on ratings:\n\n-   **Main effect of TV Show**: F(2, 84) = 0.930, p = 0.399\n\n-   **Main effect of Gender**: F(1, 84) = 0.298, p = 0.586\n\n-   **Interaction effect (TV Show \\* Gender)**: F(2, 84) = 1.871, p = 0.160\n\nThe two-way ANOVA results revealed that neither gender, show, nor their interaction had a statistically significant effect on ratings. This suggests that ratings do not vary meaningfully by gender or show, nor does the combination of show and gender influence ratings significantly.\n\n#### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test:\n\nPairwise Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests were performed due to deviations from normality:\n\n-   *Chhota Bheem* vs *Doraemon*: p = 0.09328 (not significant)\n\n-   *Chhota Bheem* vs *Dragon Tales*: p = 0.09184 (not significant)\n\n-   *Doraemon* vs *Dragon Tales*: p = 0.8694 (not significant)\n\nThe Wilcoxon tests found no significant differences between any pair of shows, aligning with the results from both ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests.\n\n#### Kruskal-Wallis Test:\n\nGiven the deviations from normality, a Kruskal-Wallis test was performed as a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA:\n\n-   **H(2) = 3.825, p = 0.1477**\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test also indicated no significant differences in ratings across the three shows, consistent with the one-way ANOVA results.\n\n#### Permutation Test:\n\nA permutation test was conducted to further assess whether the observed differences in ratings across the shows were likely due to chance:\n\n-   **p-value = 0.409**\n\nThe permutation test confirmed that the differences in ratings could likely occur by random variation, supporting the earlier results.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statistical analyses indicate no significant differences in ratings among the three TV shows, and no significant effect of gender on ratings. Both parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum) tests consistently showed that the ratings across the three shows are comparable. The permutation test further validated these findings, confirming that any observed differences are likely due to chance. Consequently, the experiment concludes that ratings do not significantly vary by TV show or gender.\n",
