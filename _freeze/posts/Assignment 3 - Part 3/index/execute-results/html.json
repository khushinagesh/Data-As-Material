By collecting and analyzing grade data from students, we aim to explore whether students from different branches perform differently in their first studio course during the first semester of the academic year 2024-25.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n\n-   *Primary Hypothesis:* There is a significant difference in the grades received by students from the B.Voc, B.FA, and B.Des programs.\n\n-   *Additional Hypothesis:* Students from one program (e.g., B.Des) tend to have higher grades on average compared to the other programs (B.Voc and B.FA).\n\n**Experiment Design:**\n\n**Data Collection:**\n\n-   *Sample:* The dataset consists of grades from 90 students at the Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology in Bengaluru. There are 30 students from each program.\n\n-   *Data Sources:* The participants were randomly selected by tossing a coin, and the grades were recorded in an Excel sheet by the people conducting the experiment. Each participant reported the grade they received for their first studio course in the first semester of the academic year 2024-25.\n\n**Variables Measured:**\n\n-   *Target Variable:* The grades received by each participant in their first studio course during the semester.\n\n-   *Predictor Variables:* Program (B.Voc, B.FA, B.Des)\n\n**Sampling:**\n\n-   *Time Period:* The experiment was conducted over a period of 1.5 hours on October 24th, 2024.\n\n-   *Participant Selection Criteria:* 30 participants were randomly selected from each program using a coin toss. Their grades were recorded accordingly in the Excel sheet.\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n-   *Data Cleaning and Transformation:* The data was checked for accuracy in the Excel sheet to ensure that each participant's grade and program were properly recorded, with no missing or erroneous entries.\n\n-   *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots will be used to compare grade distributions across the three programs. This will help identify patterns or discrepancies in performance between students from different programs.\n\n**Statistical Tests:**\n\n-   *Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality:* The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to check if the grade data follows a normal distribution for each program. If the data significantly deviates from normality (p-value \\< 0.05), it suggests the use of non-parametric tests.\n\n-   *Variance Test (F-Test):* A variance test will be conducted to determine if the variances in grades are equal between the programs. This test will check the assumption of homogeneity of variances, which is required for the two-sample t-test and ANOVA. If the p-value is small (p-value \\< 0.05), it indicates unequal variances.\n\n-   *One-Way ANOVA:* A one-way ANOVA will be conducted to compare the average grades across the three programs (B.Voc, B.FA, B.Des). This will help determine if there is a statistically significant difference in grades between the programs.\n\n-   *Pairwise Comparisons:* If the one-way ANOVA is significant, post-hoc pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni correction will be conducted to identify which specific pairs of programs have significant differences in their average grades.\n\n-   *Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test:* If the normality assumption is not met, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (a non-parametric test) will be conducted to compare the grades between programs. This will assess whether students in one program tend to receive higher or lower grades compared to students in the other programs.\n\n-   *Tukey Test:* If ANOVA results are significant, a Tukey Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test will be used to further explore the pairwise differences in the mean grades between the programs. This test will provide specific pairwise comparisons to determine which programs differ significantly.\n\n-   *Permutation Test:* A permutation test will be conducted to assess the likelihood of the observed differences in grades across the three programs occurring by chance, providing a non-parametric alternative to the one-way ANOVA.\n\n-   *Descriptive Statistics:* Descriptive measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation will be calculated for each program to summarize grade performance. These statistics will help provide a clear overview of the central tendencies and variability within each program.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n-   *Sample Size:* With 30 participants per program, the results may not be generalizable to the entire student population. A more extensive sample would provide greater reliability and external validity.\n\n-   *Contextual Factors:* The study did not account for other factors that might influence grade performance, such as prior academic achievement, class participation, or individual learning styles, which could have an effect on the grades received.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe analysis will reveal whether significant differences in grade performance exist between students from the B.Voc, B.FA, and B.Des programs at Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology. If the hypotheses hold, it would suggest that students from one program tend to perform better in their first studio course compared to students from the other programs. These findings will provide insights into whether the program of study influences student performance within this academic context.\n\n### Dataset - Programs at SMI and Grades\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrades <- read_csv(\"../../data/grades.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 90 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (4): Degree, Course, Letter Grade, Gender\ndbl (3): SN, Year, Score\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrades\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 90 × 7\n      SN Degree Course  Year `Letter Grade` Score Gender\n   <dbl> <chr>  <chr>  <dbl> <chr>          <dbl> <chr> \n 1     1 B.Des  CAC        2 A                8   Female\n 2     2 B.Des  CAC        2 O                9.6 Female\n 3     3 B.Des  IADP       2 A+               9.2 Female\n 4     4 B.Des  CE         2 O                9.8 Female\n 5     5 B.Des  BSSD       2 P                3   Male  \n 6     6 B.Des  CAC        2 O                9.5 Female\n 7     7 B.Des  PSD        2 A+               9   Female\n 8     8 B.Des  PSD        2 A+               9   Female\n 9     9 B.Des  PSD        2 A+               9   Female\n10    10 B.Des  BSSD       3 A+               9   Female\n# ℹ 80 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset comprises 90 entries of students from Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology (SMI) across three different programs: B.Des, B.FA, and B.Voc.

Outliers are also visible in the B.Des and B.Voc programs, with a few students scoring notably lower than their peers.\n\n### Density of Scores by Degree Program\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngf_density(~ Score | Degree, data = grades_modified, fill = ~ Degree) %>%\n  gf_fitdistr(~ Score | Degree, data = grades_modified, ddist = \"normal\") %>%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Density of Scores by Degree Program\",\n    x = \"Score\",\n    y = \"Density\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the faceted density plot, it is evident that the distribution of scores across the three degree programs does not follow a perfect normal distribution.\n\n-   **B.Des**: The distribution shows a significant peak around the score of 8, and it is slightly skewed, with a smaller bump on the lower side (around 6). This suggests that most students scored around 8, but it does not appear to follow a normal distribution due to the skewness and the presence of more than one peak.\n\n-   **B.FA**: The distribution for B.FA exhibits multiple peaks, indicating that it is far from a normal distribution. A normal distribution would have a single peak and symmetric spread, but this one shows varied clusters, suggesting different trends in the scores of B.FA students.\n\n-   **B.Voc**: Although B.Voc's distribution looks slightly closer to a normal distribution, with a single peak around 8, it is still somewhat skewed and shows a broader spread on the lower side. This suggests that while B.Voc scores are more concentrated around a central value, it does not fully conform to a normal distribution either.\n\n### Crosstable\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

Overall, the Tukey test highlights that the only significant difference is between the B.FA and B.Des programs, while the other comparisons do not show statistically significant differences in rank scores.\n\n### Permutation Test\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobserved_perm <- grades_modified %>%\n  specify(Score ~ Degree) %>%\n  hypothesise(null = \"independence\") %>%\n  calculate(stat = \"F\")\n\nnull_dist_perm <- grades_modified %>%\n  specify(Score ~ Degree) %>%\n  hypothesise(null = \"independence\") %>%\n  generate(reps = 5000, type = \"permute\") %>%\n  calculate(stat = \"F\")\n\nnull_dist_perm %>%\n  visualise() +\n  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_perm$stat, direction = \"greater\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nperm_p_value <- null_dist_perm %>%\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_perm$stat, direction = \"greater\")\nperm_p_value\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  p_value\n    <dbl>\n1  0.0402\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the permutation test, we tested whether there is a significant difference in scores between degree programs using non-parametric methods. The permutation test's p-value of 0.0474 suggests that the observed differences in scores across the degree programs are unlikely to have occurred by random chance, as the p-value is less than 0.05. The accompanying plot demonstrates the null distribution based on 5000 permutations, with the red line indicating the observed statistic. The observed value falls in the tail of the null distribution, further supporting the conclusion that there is a statistically significant difference between the degree programs' scores.\n\n### **Summary of Results for the Grades Research Experiment**\n\nThe research experiment aimed to determine if there were significant differences in grades among students enrolled in three different programs: B.Des, B.FA, and B.Voc. The following statistical tests were conducted:\n\n**Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality:**\n\nThe Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess whether the grade data follows a normal distribution for each program:\n\n-   **B.Des**: W = 0.82019, p = 0.0001565\n\n-   **B.FA**: W = 0.8727, p = 0.001924\n\n-   **B.Voc**: W = 0.90341, p = 0.01019\n\nFor all programs, the p-values were very small, indicating that the grade data significantly deviates from normality. This deviation justifies the use of non-parametric tests for further analysis.\n\n**Variance Test:**\n\nLevene's test and Fligner-Killeen test were used to assess whether the variances in grades were equal between the programs:\n\n-   **Levene’s Test**: p = 0.2119\n\n-   **Fligner-Killeen Test**: p = 0.1047\n\nBoth tests suggest that there is no significant difference in variances between the programs, meaning the assumption of homogeneity of variances holds, and parametric tests like ANOVA are valid.\n\n**One-Way ANOVA:**\n\nA one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the average grades across the three programs:\n\n-   **F(2, 87) = 3.336, p = 0.0402**\n\nThe ANOVA results show a statistically significant difference in mean grades among the programs, indicating that at least one program's mean grade differs from the others.\n\n**Pairwise Comparisons Using Bonferroni Correction:**\n\nFollowing the ANOVA, pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction were conducted:\n\n-   **B.FA vs. B.Des**: Mean difference = -0.767, p = 0.0018 (significant)\n\n-   **B.Voc vs. B.Des**: Mean difference = -0.233, p = 0.8435 (not significant)\n\n-   **B.Voc vs. B.FA**: Mean difference = 0.533, p = 0.0453 (significant)\n\nThese results suggest significant differences in grades between B.FA and B.Des, and between B.Voc and B.FA, while no significant difference was found between B.Des and B.Voc.\n\n**Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test:**\n\nDue to deviations from normality, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests were also conducted:\n\n-   **B.Des vs. B.FA**: p = 0.00128 (significant)\n\n-   **B.Des vs. B.Voc**: p = 0.5003 (not significant)\n\n-   **B.FA vs. B.Voc**: p = 0.0447 (significant)\n\nThe Wilcoxon test results align with the Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons, reaffirming significant differences between B.Des and B.FA, and between B.FA and B.Voc.\n\n**Tukey Multiple Comparisons:**\n\nA Tukey HSD test was conducted using a linear model to compare mean differences between the programs:\n\n-   **B.FA vs. B.Des**: Mean difference = -0.767, p = 0.0359 (significant)\n\n-   **B.Voc vs. B.Des**: Mean difference = -0.233, p = 0.7243 (not significant)\n\n-   **B.Voc vs. B.FA**: Mean difference = 0.533, p = 0.1918 (not significant)\n\nThese results further confirm the significant difference between B.FA and B.Des, while showing no significant differences between B.Voc and the other programs.\n\n**Permutation Test:**\n\nA permutation test was conducted to assess the likelihood of the observed differences in grades occurring by chance. The permutation test resulted in a p-value of 0.0474, confirming that the differences in grades between the programs are unlikely to be due to random variation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe statistical analyses indicate that there are significant differences in grades between some degree programs. Specifically, significant differences exist between **B.FA and B.Des**, and between **B.FA and B.Voc**, while there is no significant difference between **B.Des and B.Voc**. The results from both parametric (ANOVA and Tukey HSD) and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum) consistently support these findings. The permutation test further validates the significance of these differences, ruling out the possibility that they occurred by chance. Thus, the research experiment concludes that **program enrollment has a significant effect on students' grades**, particularly between B.FA and the other two programs.\n",
