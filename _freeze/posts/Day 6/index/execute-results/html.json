**Demographics**: The dataset includes fields like ID, Survey Year, Gender, Age, Age in Decades, and Race.\n\n-   **Socioeconomic Information**: It includes educational background, marital status, household income (HHIncome), and poverty index.\n\n-   **Health Measurements**: Variables such as height, weight, BMI, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic values), and cholesterol levels are captured.\n\n-   **Health Conditions and Behaviors**: Information on physical activity, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and drug use are present, along with metrics like diabetes status, sleep patterns, and general health perception.\n\n-   **Lifestyle Factors**: The dataset covers employment status, home ownership, and family size.\n\n-   **Additional Variables**: More detailed information is available on reproductive health, mental health, and sexual behavior.\n\nThe dataset contains missing values (denoted as \"NA\") in several columns, indicating that not all participants answered or

adults (individuals aged 18 or older) and includes only the \"Height\" variable. Duplicate entries are removed based on the \"ID\" column to ensure unique participants, filtering the dataset to include only those with age 18 and above, selecting only the \"Height\" variable, and finally removing any missing values (NA) from the \"Height\" column. The resulting dataset contains 4,790 rows of height data, with values ranging from around 148.1 to 181.9 cm in the displayed portion.\n\n### Population Parameters\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npop_mean <- mosaic::mean(~Height, data = NHANES_adult)\n\npop_sd <- mosaic::sd(~Height, data = NHANES_adult)\n\npop_mean\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 168.3497\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npop_sd\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 10.15705\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we calculate the mean and standard deviation of the height for adults in the NHANES dataset. The average (mean) height of the adult population is approximately 168.35 cm, with a standard deviation of 10.16 cm, which shows the typical variation around the mean. This suggests that while most adults have a height close to 168.35 cm, the heights can vary by about 10 cm above or below the mean.\n\n### Sampling\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheme_set(new = theme_custom())\nsample_50 <- mosaic::sample(NHANES_adult, size = 50) %>%\n  select(Height)\nsample_50\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 50 × 1\n   Height\n    <dbl>\n 1   170.\n 2   174.\n 3   173.\n 4   171.\n 5   170.\n 6   187.\n 7   159.\n 8   182.\n 9   180.\n10   166.\n# ℹ 40 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## A random sample of 50 observations is taken from the NHANES_adult dataset for the \"Height\" variable using mosaic::sample.

The blue-shaded area represents the population height distribution, while the grey histogram represents the sample mean distribution. The comparison shows that the sample means are generally more tightly clustered around the population mean than individual heights, demonstrating the concept of the Central Limit Theorem: as sample size increases, the distribution of the sample means becomes narrower and centered around the population mean.\n\nBoth plots highlight the relationship between the sample mean distribution and the original population distribution, illustrating how random samples from a population can reflect the underlying characteristics of the entire population.\n\n### Sampling Height repeatedly\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsamples_08_1000 <- do(1000) * mean(resample(NHANES_adult$Height, size = 08))\n\nsamples_16_1000 <- do(1000) * mean(resample(NHANES_adult$Height, size = 16))\n\nsamples_32_1000 <- do(1000) * mean(resample(NHANES_adult$Height, size = 32))\n\nsamples_64_1000 <- do(1000) * mean(resample(NHANES_adult$Height, size = 64))\n## Four different sets of samples are drawn, each with a different sample size (8, 16, 32, and 64)\n## For each sample size, the resample() function draws a random sample of heights, and the mean() function calculates the mean height of the resample.\n## This process is repeated 1000 times for each sample size using the do(1000) function.\n\nhead(samples_08_1000)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      mean\n1 163.6250\n2 171.0750\n3 167.2000\n4 167.6875\n5 170.8375\n6 167.2750\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe table shows the first six mean heights from 1000 random samples of size 8 drawn from the NHANES adult dataset.

This variability demonstrates the random nature of sampling, with each sample producing slightly different mean values even though they are drawn from the same population.

This pattern highlights that larger sample sizes produce more precise estimates of the population mean, with less variability.\n\n### Confidence Intervals\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheme_set(new = theme_custom())\n\ntbl_1 <- get_ci(samples_08_1000, level = 0.95)\ntbl_2 <- get_ci(samples_16_1000, level = 0.95)\ntbl_3 <- get_ci(samples_32_1000, level = 0.95)\ntbl_4 <- get_ci(samples_64_1000, level = 0.95)\nrbind(tbl_1, tbl_2, tbl_3, tbl_4) %>%\n  rownames_to_column(\"index\") %>%\n  cbind(\"sample_size\" = c(8, 16, 32, 64)) %>%\n  gf_segment(index + index ~ lower_ci + upper_ci) %>%\n  gf_vline(xintercept = pop_mean) %>%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"95% Confidence Intervals for the Mean\",\n    subtitle = \"Varying samples sizes 8-16-32-64\",\n    y = \"Sample Size\", x = \"Mean Ranges\"\n  ) %>%\n  gf_refine(scale_y_discrete(labels = c(8, 16, 32, 64))) %>%\n  gf_refine(annotate(geom = \"label\", x = pop_mean + 1.75, y = 1.5, label = \"Population Mean\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## The function get_ci() calculates 95% confidence intervals for the mean of the samples (samples_08_1000, samples_16_1000, samples_32_1000, and samples_64_1000), which represent 1000 resampled means of different sizes (8, 16, 32, 64).\n## Four variables (tbl_1, tbl_2, tbl_3, tbl_4) are created, each containing the confidence intervals (lower and upper bounds) for a specific sample size.\n## The rbind() function combines these four datasets (tbl_1, tbl_2, tbl_3, and tbl_4) row-wise into one table.\n## The cbind() function adds a sample_size column with the values 8, 16, 32, and 64 to correspond with each confidence interval.\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis plot shows the 95% confidence intervals for the mean of different sample sizes (`8`, `16`, `32`, and `64`). Each horizontal line represents the confidence interval for a given sample size, with the vertical line marking the population mean. The plot visually demonstrates how the confidence intervals become narrower as the sample size increases, indicating more precise estimates of the population mean. The intervals for smaller samples are wider, reflecting greater variability, while larger sample sizes yield tighter intervals that are more closely aligned with the population mean. This helps illustrate the concept that larger sample sizes provide more accurate estimates of the population parameter.\n\n### Confidence Intervals and the Bell Curve\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheme_set(new = theme_custom())\n\nsample_mean <- mean(~Height, data = sample_16)\nse <- sd(~Height, data = sample_16) / sqrt(16)\n\nxqnorm(\n  p = c(0.025, 0.975),\n  mean = sample_mean,\n  sd = sd(~Height, data = sample_16),\n  return = c(\"plot\"), verbose = F\n) %>%\n  gf_vline(xintercept = ~pop_mean, colour = \"black\") %>%\n  gf_vline(xintercept = mean(~Height, data = sample_16), colour = \"purple\") %>%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Confidence Intervals and the Bell Curve.

It shows a bell curve divided into three probability sections: the outermost areas represent the lower and upper 2.5% of the data, and the middle section highlights the 95% confidence interval, which covers the majority of the data. Two vertical lines are present—one representing the sample mean (in purple) and the other the population mean (in black).\n\n### Calculating confidence interval\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npop_mean\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 168.3497\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nse <- sd(~Height, data = sample_16) / sqrt(16)\nmean(~Height, data = sample_16) - 2.0 * se\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 159.6467\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(~Height, data = sample_16) + 2.0 * se\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 169.8408\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe code calculates the 95% confidence interval for the mean of a sample of 16 observations. It computes the standard error (SE) of the sample mean and then uses it to find the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval. The output shows the population mean (168.3497) and the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval, which are 162.7563 and 169.2937, respectively. This interval gives an estimate of where the true population mean is likely to lie based on the sample.\n",
